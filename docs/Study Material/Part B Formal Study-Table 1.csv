2,T1P1,Yes,1,SP2T1P101,1,The Coffee Shop,1,"Teddy worked in a small but very popular coffee shop located near the center of the city. The shop had large windows that allowed sunlight to stream in during the morning, and on this particular day, the sky was clear and bright, giving the entire space a warm glow. Customers flowed steadily through the door, creating a lively atmosphere filled with the scent of freshly ground coffee beans and the gentle hum of soft background music. Teddy moved efficiently behind the counter, preparing drinks, calling out orders, and greeting regular customers with familiar smiles. He enjoyed days like these when good weather brought more people out, filling the shop with conversations, laptops, notebooks, and the comforting rhythm of daily routines. Despite the continuous rush, he remained calm and attentive, making sure each drink was made properly and every customer felt welcomed. The morning passed quickly as Teddy worked through one order after another, until he finally noticed a young woman who had taken a seat by the window with her laptop open. She appeared focused, typing quickly while sipping the latte she had just purchased. Teddy paid little attention at first, assuming she was simply another customer settling into her usual work habits. He had no idea he would soon be directly involved in her morning."
2,T1P1,Yes,1,SP2T1P102,1,The Coffee Shop,2,"The young woman sat at the same table many customers preferred—near an outlet and touched by natural light. She wore a simple beige sweater and had tied her hair loosely behind her head, giving her a calm and studious appearance. From where Teddy stood, he could see her concentrating on her screen, occasionally pausing to take notes or adjust her glasses. The coffee shop remained busy, with people coming in to grab to-go cups, meeting friends, or settling down to work just like she did. Although Teddy was used to the ebb and flow of customers, he occasionally glanced toward her table when he had a free moment. Something about her quiet focus made her stand out in the bustling environment. As the minutes passed, Teddy noticed her expression change. The young woman pressed a key several times, frowned, and then tapped the side of the laptop as if hoping it would respond. The screen suddenly froze, leaving her staring at an unresponsive page. She tried to restart the device, but nothing happened. Her shoulders tensed, and she let out a small sigh of frustration. Around her, customers continued chatting and typing, unaware of her growing concern. Teddy sensed something was wrong, and although he was uncertain whether he should intervene, he kept her in his peripheral vision, waiting to see if she might need assistance."
2,T1P1,Yes,1,SP2T1P103,1,The Coffee Shop,3,"A few minutes later, the woman closed her eyes briefly as if trying to calm herself. She pressed the power button again, but the laptop remained dark and unresponsive. It was clear that she could no longer continue her work. She glanced around the café, perhaps hoping someone nearby might understand technology better than she did. Some customers were engaged in meetings over headphones, while others were deep in conversation. Teddy felt a small tug of responsibility. Although he was not a technician, he often helped people with minor issues like connecting to the Wi-Fi or finding a power outlet. He approached her table politely during a lull in the orders. In a soft, professional tone, he asked whether she needed help. The woman looked up, surprised but relieved to be acknowledged. She explained that her laptop had suddenly stopped working and that she had an important task to complete. Teddy asked if she would allow him to take a quick look. She agreed, moving aside to give him room. He gently lifted the device, checked the power indicator, and pressed a combination of keys to reset the hardware—a simple trick he had learned from a friend. After a few seconds, the screen flickered back to life. The woman gasped with visible relief, her shoulders finally relaxing."
2,T1P1,Yes,1,SP2T1P104,1,The Coffee Shop,4,"Once the laptop successfully restarted, Teddy stepped back, giving her space to verify that everything was functioning properly. She clicked through several tabs, tested her keyboard, and checked the file she had been working on. Everything appeared normal, and color returned to her face as she realized her progress had not been lost. She looked up at Teddy with genuine gratitude, thanking him several times for stepping in at the right moment. Teddy nodded modestly, insisting it had been a very small fix and that anyone could have done it. The woman shook her head, explaining that she had been under significant time pressure and that his help had prevented her from losing valuable work. A few nearby customers briefly observed the interaction, smiling at the small but meaningful exchange. As Teddy prepared to return to the counter, she asked for his name and repeated her thanks with a sincerity that made him pause. He told her his name, slightly embarrassed by the attention, then excused himself when new customers approached the register. As he resumed his tasks, he occasionally glanced toward her table. She appeared far calmer now, typing steadily once more. Teddy felt quietly satisfied, knowing that a simple action had made someone’s morning a little easier."
2,T1P1,Yes,1,SP2T1P105,1,The Coffee Shop,5,"About fifteen minutes later, the café had settled into a comfortable rhythm again. People continued moving in and out, carrying paper cups and weaving between tables. The young woman eventually closed her laptop with a sense of completion and walked back to the counter. Teddy looked up, prepared to take another order, but she held no menu or cup. Instead, she placed a new drink—a cappuccino—onto the counter and gently pushed it toward him. She explained that she had ordered it specifically for him as a gesture of thanks. Teddy was momentarily taken aback. Employees rarely received drinks from customers, and he was not accustomed to being on the receiving end of such gestures. She insisted that he accept it, emphasizing how much his help had meant to her. After a brief hesitation, he thanked her sincerely and accepted the warm cup. It smelled rich and slightly sweet, a pleasant contrast to the busy atmosphere around him. The young woman smiled, waved lightly, and returned to her seat to pack her belongings. Although the café remained as lively as ever, that small moment stood out to Teddy, adding a gentle brightness to his workday."
2,T1P1,Yes,1,SP2T1P106,1,The Coffee Shop,6,"Later in the afternoon, when the coffee shop grew quieter, Teddy took a brief break and finally drank the cappuccino she had given him. It had cooled slightly, but the flavor remained smooth and comforting. He sat by the window for a moment, observing the passing crowds and reflecting on the morning’s events. Nothing extraordinary had happened: no major incident, no dramatic twist, no unusual customer behavior. Yet the small interaction reminded him why he appreciated his work. The coffee shop was not merely a place where drinks were made; it was a space where everyday lives intersected, sometimes in simple but meaningful ways. The young woman had already left, and Teddy did not expect to see her again. Still, the exchange lingered in his thoughts. It reaffirmed his belief that small acts of kindness, even something as ordinary as restarting a malfunctioning laptop, could make a noticeable difference to someone’s day. When his break ended, Teddy returned to the counter with renewed energy. The sun was still bright outside, customers continued to drift in and out, and the café felt warm and familiar. Teddy resumed his tasks, carrying with him the quiet satisfaction of having helped someone, and the unexpected kindness he received in return."

2,T2P1,Yes,1,SP2T2P101,1,Lily‘s Garden,1,"Lily was a cheerful young girl who lived with her parents in a house surrounded by a remarkably large and beautiful garden. The garden was one of the family’s most treasured places, filled with flowers of every color and variety. Roses, tulips, daisies, peonies, and lilies bloomed throughout the seasons, creating a vivid landscape that changed with the weather. The paths between the flowerbeds were lined with white stones, and small wooden benches were placed beneath the trees where sunlight filtered through the leaves. Lily spent many afternoons playing among the blossoms, gently touching petals and collecting fallen leaves. She frequently invited her friends to join her, and they would run between the bushes, play hide-and-seek, or sit on the soft grass sharing stories. The garden always felt safe and welcoming, almost as if it were alive with a quiet magic. Lily’s parents lovingly tended to it every day, pruning, watering, and planting new seedlings. They always reminded Lily to be gentle with the flowers because the garden was full of life that needed care. Lily agreed wholeheartedly, believing the garden to be one of the happiest places in the world, a place where she could laugh freely and feel connected to something larger than herself."
2,T2P1,Yes,1,SP2T2P102,1,Lily‘s Garden,2,"On this particular day, the garden was even livelier than usual because it was Lily’s birthday. Her parents had planned a large garden party for her, decorating every corner with ribbons, lanterns, and colorful paper flags. A long table was set beneath the biggest tree, covered with treats, cake, and fresh fruit. Lily’s friends arrived with handmade cards and small presents, filling the garden with excited voices and cheerful laughter. Music played softly from a speaker hidden among the bushes, blending with the rustling leaves and distant birdsong. As the children ran through the garden, the flowers seemed to sway in rhythm, brightening the atmosphere with their colors. Everything felt joyful and perfect until Lily tripped over a small stone while chasing a butterfly. She stumbled forward and fell to the ground. Several guests gasped, and her parents rushed toward her, expecting tears or a scraped knee. Surprisingly, Lily stood up immediately without any injury. She brushed off her dress, smiled, and insisted she felt perfectly fine. Her parents exchanged puzzled glances before reassuring Lily that she must have been very lucky. Half joking but half sincere, they told her that perhaps the garden’s fairies had protected her at the last moment. The children laughed at the idea, but none of them completely dismissed it."
2,T2P1,Yes,1,SP2T2P103,1,Lily‘s Garden,3,"As evening arrived, the guests left, and the garden gradually quieted. The lanterns glowed softly, casting warm circles of light on the grass. Lily went to bed happily, unaware that the garden would become lively once more after she fell asleep. When the moon rose, the flower fairies—small, delicate beings who lived among the blossoms—emerged from their hiding places. They had translucent wings, glowing like petals kissed by dew, and their bodies shimmered faintly in the moonlight. These fairies had existed in the garden long before Lily was born. They cared for the flowers, guided seeds as they sprouted, and ensured that the plants remained healthy. On this night, they gathered in the center of the garden to talk about the events of the day. Several fairies spoke about Lily’s fall, explaining how they had fluttered quickly beneath her to cushion the impact. Their wings had softened her landing, preventing any injury. Other fairies discussed the joy of watching the children play, remarking how Lily’s laughter always carried a special warmth that encouraged the flowers to bloom more brightly. The fairies agreed that the birthday celebration had been lovely and that their help had gone unnoticed, just as it should."
2,T2P1,Yes,1,SP2T2P104,1,Lily‘s Garden,4,"After talking about Lily’s party, the fairies turned their attention to their annual meeting, a tradition they held each year when the garden was quiet and still. The meeting was important because it determined which fairies would take on specific responsibilities for the coming year. Some fairies cared for the roses, while others watched over the tulips or tended to the soil beneath the trees. During the meeting, nominations were made, and volunteers stepped forward. The fairy council discussed who had shown dedication, patience, and creativity in their tasks. Although the meeting was conducted with seriousness, there was also a sense of excitement in the air. Each fairy took great pride in their work, knowing that the health and beauty of the garden depended on their cooperation. They also talked about changes they wanted to make, such as encouraging new wildflowers to grow or finding better ways to protect young seedlings from heavy rain. By the time the meeting ended, the moon had moved higher in the sky, shining brightly over the silent garden. The fairies concluded their gathering with a gentle dance among the petals, their wings creating a soft hum that blended with the night breeze. Eventually, one by one, they returned to their hiding places."
2,T2P1,Yes,1,SP2T2P105,1,Lily‘s Garden,5,"Before retreating completely, a few of the fairies flew to the spot where Lily had fallen earlier that day. They inspected the ground, making sure the soil was soft and the grass unharmed. One fairy touched the petals of a nearby flower, whispering a small blessing to ensure the garden would continue protecting Lily. The fairies held a fond affection for the little girl, who always treated the flowers with gentle hands and respectful curiosity. They believed that kindness toward nature strengthened their magic, and Lily’s presence brought a constant warmth that made their work easier. As the night grew deeper, the fairies wondered what adventures next year’s birthday celebration might bring and whether Lily would continue to grow close to the garden. Satisfied that everything was as it should be, they glided upward through the branches and disappeared into the moonlit blossoms. The garden returned to its peaceful, resting state. By the time the first faint glow of dawn appeared at the horizon, the fairies were already asleep, hidden beneath leaves, petals, and moss-covered stones where no human eye could find them."
2,T2P1,Yes,1,SP2T2P106,1,Lily‘s Garden,6,"The next morning, Lily woke up early and hurried outside with her parents to water the flowers, just as they did every weekend. The sunlight was soft, and the garden looked as vibrant as ever, as if it had been freshly polished during the night. Lily carried a small watering can while her parents used the larger ones to reach the taller plants. She stepped carefully between the flowerbeds, saying good morning to the blossoms the way she always did. Her parents watched her fondly, still amused by how energetic she remained even after a full day of celebrating. Lily knelt beside a patch of lilies and touched one of the petals. She thought she saw a faint shimmer, but it disappeared before she could be sure. The flowers swayed lightly, as if greeting her. Although Lily did not know exactly what had happened during the night, she felt a quiet sense of comfort, as though the garden itself was pleased to see her again. Her parents reminded her to water each plant gently, and she nodded seriously, wanting to do everything correctly. As they continued working together under the brightening sky, the garden seemed to glow with a subtle happiness. Hidden among the blossoms, the fairies slept peacefully, content to watch over Lily for another year."

2,T3P0,No,0,SP2T3P001,0,The Warrior and the Dragon,1,"Alice lived in a small, quiet village bordered by fields, streams, and forests. She was the daughter of the village librarian and spent most of her days exploring old books, dusting shelves, and listening to travelers’ stories. Life in the village moved at a gentle pace, and Alice never imagined anything would disturb its peaceful routine. But the calm was shattered when war suddenly erupted, sweeping across the land with terrifying speed. Villagers fled in panic, families scattered in different directions, and the once-safe roads became dangerous overnight. Alice found herself separated from her parents amid the chaos and smoke of the first attack. She wandered for days, surviving on river water and wild berries. Eventually, she collapsed near an abandoned crossroads, too exhausted to continue. When she woke, she found herself surrounded not by soldiers or villagers but by bright tents, colorful flags, and unfamiliar faces painted in cheerful colors. What she did not expect was to discover that she had been rescued by a traveling circus that claimed they had been “looking for her” long before the war even began."
2,T3P0,No,0,SP2T3P002,0,The Warrior and the Dragon,2,"The circus troupe welcomed Alice warmly, offering food, shelter, and comfort she had never imagined finding in the middle of a war. Among them was an elderly magician who noticed Alice’s fascination with illusions and sleight of hand. He took her under his wing, teaching her simple tricks at first—coin flips, ribbon vanishing acts, harmless sparks from enchanted stones. Over time, she learned more complex routines, and the magician remarked that she possessed an instinctive understanding of magic that even seasoned performers lacked. One afternoon, while the troupe prepared for another show, Alice slipped away into the nearby forest to gather apples from a tree she often visited. She picked a bright red apple, polished it against her sleeve, and took a confident bite. However, the sweetness she expected never reached her tongue. Instead, a strange numbness spread across her body, and her vision blurred. She collapsed onto the forest floor as consciousness slipped away. When she finally awoke, she was lying alone in the clearing—surrounded not by apples or forest creatures, but by the distinct footprints of something large enough to crush a wagon."
2,T3P0,No,0,SP2T3P003,0,The Warrior and the Dragon,3,"Disoriented and shaken, Alice returned to the circus camp as quickly as she could. But when she arrived, the colorful tents were gone. The wagons had vanished, the fires were extinguished, and even the tracks the troupe usually left behind had disappeared. It was as if the entire circus had been swallowed by the earth. Just as panic began to rise in her chest, a voice called her name from behind a broken fence. A hooded stranger stepped forward, carrying a book wrapped in cloth and a sealed letter. He told her they were left behind by the magician, who had departed in a great hurry. Alice reached out to accept the items, but before she could ask any questions, the stranger dropped the calm expression he had worn earlier and drew a blade from inside his coat. Without warning, he lunged toward her with surprising speed. Alice barely managed to dodge the attack. She stumbled backward, clutching the book tightly. When she regained her footing, the stranger was already retreating into the trees—but not before she noticed that his shadow moved in the shape of a serpent rather than a man."
2,T3P0,No,0,SP2T3P004,0,The Warrior and the Dragon,4,"Shaken but determined, Alice opened the magician’s letter once she was safely hidden among the forest roots. The handwriting was unmistakably his, elegant yet hurried. He explained that the war devastating the land was not caused by human armies but by a single ancient dragon whose awakening had thrown the realm into disorder. The circus had uncovered this truth unexpectedly and decided to confront the dragon in secret. Knowing the journey would be dangerous, they chose not to bring Alice along. The magician expressed hope that she would remain safe and promised to return for her once the mission was complete. As she finished reading, tears welled in her eyes—not from fear, but from the realization that the entire troupe had risked their lives for strangers who had no idea they were being protected. She vowed to follow them, no matter how dangerous the path might be. She gathered supplies, tucked the magician’s book into her bag, and headed toward the mountains where rumors said the dragon dwelled. She had taken only a few steps when the ground beneath her shifted, revealing faintly glowing runes that spelled her name in a language she had never learned."
2,T3P0,No,0,SP2T3P005,0,The Warrior and the Dragon,5,"The journey to the dragon’s territory was long and perilous. Alice crossed abandoned villages, scorched forests, and rivers blackened by the dragon’s smoke. Eventually she reached a cavern large enough to swallow a castle. Inside, she discovered shattered circus props, broken wagons, and the magician’s hat lying among the debris. Her heart tightened as she realized the troupe had faced the dragon and failed. The dragon itself soon emerged, scales shimmering like molten metal and eyes burning with ancient intelligence. Alice stood her ground, gripping a sword she had found near the cavern entrance. The sword trembled in her hands until suddenly it glowed, filling her veins with strength she had never known. Even so, she barely managed to parry the dragon’s attacks. Just as the creature prepared its final strike, something odd happened: the dragon paused, nostrils flaring, gaze locked on her backpack. Alice blinked, unsure whether she had imagined the shift in its behavior. The dragon lowered its head, sniffed once more, and then lunged—not at her, but directly at the bag that had begun glowing faintly without her touching it."
2,T3P0,No,0,SP2T3P006,0,The Warrior and the Dragon,6,"Alice stumbled backward as the dragon tore open her backpack with surprising eagerness. Apples from the forest tumbled out, rolling across the cavern floor. The dragon sniffed one, licked it once, and ate it without hesitation. Immediately, its eyes widened, its legs wobbled, and the giant creature collapsed with a thunderous crash. The cavern shook, dust billowing from the ceiling. Alice stared, stunned, as the dragon let out a tremendous snore and fell into a deep sleep. Only then did she recall the strange numbness she had felt after eating an apple earlier. She knelt beside the dragon, examining its breathing. It was alive—just unconscious. The apples, she realized, must have been enchanted. Perhaps they had been meant for her, or perhaps for the circus, or perhaps they had been planted long ago for reasons no one could guess. The dragon’s chest rose and fell slowly, peacefully, as if centuries of rage had been replaced by exhaustion. Alice dropped to the ground, overwhelmed by relief. The sword’s glow faded, and her limbs finally relaxed. She had prepared to fight a dragon, but she had not expected to defeat it by accident. And she certainly had not expected the dragon, even in sleep, to mutter her name."

2,T4P0,No,0,SP2T4P001,0,The Museum,1,"Alan worked the late shift at the city museum, a quiet place filled with artifacts from different eras, arranged carefully behind glass and polished to a shine that seemed to outlast time itself. He moved slowly through the dim corridors, checking the locked cabinets and ensuring everything was in its proper place. The museum always felt colder after sunset, and the hush in the halls often made him more aware of his own thoughts—particularly the ones he didn’t want to think about. His rent and utility bills were due next month, and no matter how many times he revised his budget, the numbers seemed increasingly impossible. On top of that, his coworker Lina still hadn’t arrived. She was supposed to share the shift with him, as she always did on Thursday nights. It wasn’t like her to be late, and Alan found himself glancing toward the entrance more often than usual. He tried to reassure himself by focusing on his tasks, walking from one gallery to the next. When he approached the room filled with doll exhibits—hundreds of porcelain faces watching silently from their shelves—he felt an unexpected chill. Then he heard it: a tiny, distinct sound echoing through the stillness, something like a tap or whisper brushing against the display glass. Suddenly, a sound came from the room filled with doll exhibits."
2,T4P0,No,0,SP2T4P002,0,The Museum,2,"Alan hesitated for a moment before pushing open the door to the doll room. The air inside was noticeably cooler, as though the temperature had dropped only within that space. He flicked on the brighter overhead lights, letting them wash over rows of dolls dressed in old-fashioned clothing—lace bonnets, frilled dresses, sailor suits. But everything was perfectly still. No doll was out of place. No case was open. No object had fallen. Determined to convince himself he was simply tired, he stepped back into the hallway and continued his routine patrol. The creak of the old wooden floorboards beneath his shoes grounded him somewhat, pulling him back to the more practical concerns of the night. When he reached the staircase leading to the first floor, he released a slow breath, relieved to be out of that unsettling room. As he descended, a sudden knocking echoed through the entrance hall below. It was firm and rhythmic, the kind of knock someone would make when they expected an immediate response. Alan hurried toward the door, thinking Lina had finally arrived. The thought eased him; at least he wouldn’t be alone with the strange noises. He unlocked the heavy front door and pulled it open, bracing himself for Lina’s apology for being late. But instead of Lina, a small boy was standing outside the door."
2,T4P0,No,0,SP2T4P003,0,The Museum,3,"Alan blinked in surprise at the sight of the child, who looked no older than seven. The boy stood shivering slightly in the cool night air, his hands tucked into the pockets of a thin jacket that wasn’t warm enough for the weather. Alan crouched down to the boy’s height and asked gently where his parents were. The boy lifted his eyes—dark, wide, and strangely calm—and said he had been walking with his mother before the two of them became separated near the museum. Hearing this, Alan’s concern deepened. He guided the child inside and seated him on a wooden bench in the lobby, offering reassurance that help would come soon. Then he made the necessary call to the police, reporting the situation clearly and requesting immediate assistance. The boy sat silently during the call, staring ahead with an expression that was difficult to read. Alan checked the time—five minutes had already passed. Every minute felt longer than the last as he waited for the officers. Suddenly, another round of knocking sounded at the door. This time the knocks were lighter, quicker, more familiar. Thinking the police had arrived earlier than expected, Alan hurried back to the entrance and opened it. But this time, it was Lina."
2,T4P0,No,0,SP2T4P004,0,The Museum,4,"Lina stepped in, brushing the cold from her sleeves and apologizing breathlessly for her delay. But once her eyes landed on the boy, she stopped mid-sentence. Something about him unsettled her, though she couldn’t explain why. Meanwhile, the boy wandered slowly around the lobby, studying the exhibits behind glass as though he were seeing them for the first time. He paused in front of an old taxidermy bird, then turned to the two adults and asked in a whisper whether the museum’s objects came alive at night. Alan forced a laugh, claiming that nothing in the museum ever moved on its own. But Lina didn’t laugh. Instead, she gently pulled Alan aside, lowering her voice. She unlocked her phone and showed him a breaking news report: a young boy had been hit by a speeding car minutes earlier at the exact intersection beside the museum. The article included a blurry image of the accident scene along with a brief statement that the child had been rushed away before witnesses could provide details. "
2,T4P0,No,0,SP2T4P005,0,The Museum,5,"A cold knot formed in Alan’s stomach as the situation became harder and harder to rationalize. The boy’s calmness, the strange timing, and Lina’s unease all pressed together into a discomfort he couldn’t shake. Yet before he could ask Lina more questions, the loud clacking of footsteps echoed from outside, followed by firm knocks on the museum door. Alan felt instant relief—finally, the police had arrived. Two officers stepped into the building, shining their flashlights briefly around the lobby. They spoke gently to the boy, confirmed his name, and assured him that they would help him find his mother. The child followed obediently, not speaking a word as they guided him toward the door. Before leaving, one of the officers turned to Alan and asked a routine question: “Are you the only staff member here tonight?” Alan blinked, confused, and immediately pointed to Lina standing right beside him. The officer frowned, scanning the empty air where Alan had gestured. His eyes moved back to Alan with a puzzled expression, repeating the question as though he hadn’t heard the first answer. The officer said he could only see Alan."
2,T4P0,No,0,SP2T4P006,0,The Museum,6,"Alan felt a ripple of cold pass through him as the officer continued speaking. The child, he clarified, had not actually been struck by the car. He had been seconds away from being hit when a passerby pulled him out of the vehicle’s path. That passerby was a young woman wearing a museum badge—the same badge Lina always kept pinned to her shirt. Alan turned to Lina slowly, and the shock on her face mirrored his own. Her outline seemed faint, almost translucent around the edges, as though she existed slightly apart from the world around her. Alan whispered that she had to return to her body, but Lina shook her head, saying she didn’t know how. Before either of them could speak again, soft tapping noises echoed through the hall—tiny footsteps, too light to belong to a person. Lina’s form flickered, dimmed, and vanished toward the museum’s front doors as though pulled by invisible threads. Alan rushed out after her, but by the time he reached the street, she was already gone. When he arrived at the hospital, a nurse informed him that Lina had woken up moments ago. She told him she remembered only fragments: a long hallway of moonlight, the porcelain dolls from the museum walking in solemn procession—and how they gently escorted her back into her own body. Then she frowned at Alan and added, almost annoyed:  “And one of them kept insisting I still hadn’t finished last week’s inventory report.”"
