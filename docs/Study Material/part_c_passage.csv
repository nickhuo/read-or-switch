1,101,1,101101,01,pTitle0101101,"A bone graft is the transplant of bone tissue. Surgeons use bone grafts to repair and rebuild diseased bones, tendons and cartilage in the hips, knees and spine. Grafts can also be used to repair bone loss caused by fractures from accidents, or to enhance the density and quality of existing bone, or to reduce suffering from a variety of illnesses, such as tumors or cancers. Once the body receives the bone graft, it provides a framework for growth of fresh and living bone. If the transplanted bone comes from another person, it is called an allograft. Most allograft bone comes from donors who have died. Tissue banks carefully screen the medical histories of the donors and freeze the donated bones. After harvesting, the tissue bank will process and prepare the donated bone to ensure that it is safe to use to reduce the risks of contamination, infection or disease transmission. If the transplanted bone originates from another part of the patient’s own body, it is called an autograft. In some cases, a man-made bone substitute is used as an alternative for the bone graft. During the surgery, the physician often makes a cut into the bone near the defect where the graft is to be placed. The potential drawbacks of the surgical procedure include chronic pain from the surgical site (e.g., if nerves are inadvertently cut) or rejection of transplants."
1,101,1,101102,02,pTitle0101102,"Only living cells can make new bone, so the success of any bone grafting procedure is dependent on having enough bone-forming cells in the location of the graft.  Such bone-forming cells are called “osteogenic” bone cells. Osteogenic cells are located in the periosteum, which is the tissue surrounding the bone and the bone marrow. A wound such as a fracture triggers cell production by the osteogenic cells, creating new osteoblasts and osteoclasts for damage remedy as quickly as possible. Osteoblasts are responsible for the creation of new bone. Osteoclasts are responsible for breaking down bone cells, which is required for bone reconstruction. However, locations of scarring, previous surgery or infection, bone gaps, and locations previously treated with radiation therapy are all likely to be deficient in osteogenic cells. In this situation, osteogenic stimulation is needed. Osteogenic cells can be added to a graft site from two sources, bone or bone marrow. Typically, healthy bone is removed from a location where it is unlikely to cause a disability and then transferred into the graft site. This is often from sites of the anterior or posterior pelvic iliac crests.  It has recently become more accepted to transfer bone-forming cells from bone marrow, which can be obtained with a needle, without an open, incisional operation."
1,101,1,101103,03,pTitle0101103,"Bone grafts refer to a wide variety of surgical methods to augment or stimulate the formation of new bone where it is needed. One function of bone graft is to support the healing of fresh fractures or fractures that have failed to heal after an initial attempt at treatment. It can also be used to regenerate bone, which is lost or missing as a result of trauma, infection, or disease. Reconstruction or rebuilding of missing bone can vary from filling small cavities to replacing large segments of bone that are 12 or more inches in length. Another function of bone grafts is to regenerate the bone tissue around the devices implanted in a surgery, such as in artificial joint replacements (e.g., hip replacement) or devices used to support bone alignment. Finally, another function is to stimulate healing between two bones across a diseased joint. This is called “arthrodesis” or “fusion.” One of the most common examples is to promote spinal fusion. Spinal fusions are performed to relieve pain and provide stability to spines in people who have been suffering from a vertebral fracture or when motion between the vertebrae causes pain. Once the bone “bridge” between the vertebrae is in place, the spine is stabilized. Then, the pressure on nerve roots is relieved. Thus, it can further ease pain."
1,101,1,101104,04,pTitle0101104,"There are a number of different reasons that a physician may recommend bone grafting. Situations in which the recovery process from bone surgery is compromised often call for grafting. Diseases such as diabetes or autoimmune deficiencies can slow bone cells growth so that bone grafts can offset the effects of disease. Another case for which the physician may suggest grafting is when a large amount of bone or disc material is taken during surgery, such as spinal procedures that span many levels of vertebrae. Many medical studies show that patients who are constantly exposed to nicotine tend to have limited progress in recovery. So smokers facing spinal surgery routinely receive bone grafts. One study tested how well the bone mass fuses together in spinal fusion patients. Results showed that the nonunion rate is lowest (14%) for nonsmokers, slightly higher (17%) for patients who quit smoking for at least 6 months after surgery, and is highest (26%) for patients who continued to smoke. Nicotine acts like a poison in the bone, inhibiting fusion of the bone. One of the most negative effects of nicotine is decreased blood flow of the bone graft. In essence, the bone graft does not get enough nutrients due to a lack of blood supply; therefore, the bone does not recover smoothly."
1,101,1,101105,05,pTitle0101105,"After a bone graft operation, recovery time depends on the injury or defect being treated and the size of the bone graft. The process may take 2 weeks to 3 months. The bone graft itself will take up to 3 months or longer to completely heal. Children heal faster than adults. Pain is normal for a few days following surgery, and medication is given regularly to alleviate this problem. Antibiotics may be given to help lower the risk of infection. Patients are asked to take the prescribed antibiotics as directed; however, they can discontinue the use of antibiotic in the event of a rash or other unfavorable reaction. Patients have to keep the bone graft sites clean and dry. Doctors or nurses often give detailed instructions about showering. If wearing a cast, it is beneficial to apply heat to the injured site to improve blood circulation and speed up healing. After the cast is removed, patients have to massage the injured site with ice and avoid extreme exercise for up to 6 months. However, patients still need to exercise the non-affected muscle groups to maintain overall health during the recovery process.  Finally, patients are told to follow a nutritious diet and avoid alcoholic beverage. If possible, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, NSAIDs and systemic corticosteroids should be avoided since all of these treatments are known to slow down the recovery process."
1,101,1,101106,06,pTitle0101106,"Scientists have long searched for materials that could be used to replace transplanted bone. Although most of the substitutes available produce successful outcomes, none have yet achieved the advantages of real bone. There are some bone graft alternatives. Demineralized Bone Matrix (DBM) contains collagen, proteins and growth factors that are extracted from the bone. DBM is extensively processed and therefore has little possibility for disease transmission. However, because it contains mostly collagen, and not the composite materials of calcium that make the bone rigid, it does not provide strength to the surgical site. Ceramics are also used as a substitute for bone grafts. Ceramics offer no possibility for disease transmission, although they may be associated with inflammation in some patients. They are available in many forms such as porous and mesh. Although ceramics may offer a frame for bone regeneration, they contain none of the natural proteins that influence or facilitate bone regeneration. Another bone graft substitute is graft composite. Graft composites use combinations of other bone grafting materials and bone growth factors to gain the benefits of a variety of substances. One composite combines both collagen and ceramic, which closely reproduces the composition of natural bone. The other composite combines DBM with bone marrow cells, which aid in the growth of new bone."
1,101,1,101107,07,pTitle0101107,"One function of bone graft is to support the healing of fresh fractures or fractures that have failed to heal. A fracture is a breach in the outer layer of the bone, called the cortex. Following the fracture, secondary healing begins, which consists of four steps. The first stage is hematoma formation, beginning immediately following the fracture. The blood vessels supplying the bone and periosteum are ruptured during the fracture, causing a hematoma to form around the fracture site. The hematoma clots, and forms the temporary frame for healing. The injury to bone results in the secretion of inflammatory molecules and that stimulate essential cellular biology at the site. Different cells act together to remove damaged tissue and secrete more chemicals to facilitate bone regeneration. The second stage is cartilaginous callus formation, where stem cells are recruited to the area and begin to differentiate. As a result, a cartilaginous network rich in collagen spans the fracture ends, and a layer of woven bone is laid down by the osteogenic cells. The third stage is bony callus formation, adding calcium that make the bone rigid. Woven bone continues to be laid down on the outside. The newly formed blood vessels continue to proliferate, allowing further migration of stem cells. At the end of this phase, a hard callus of immature bone forms."
1,101,1,101108,08,pTitle0101108,"Failed or delayed healing can affect up to 10% of all fractures and can be due to various factors like infection, tumor, and disrupted blood supply. One important function of bone graft is to support the healing of fractures that have failed to heal. There are many factors that can affect fracture healing, as well as methods to stimulate fracture healing. Factors that affect fracture healing can mainly categorize into local and systemic categories. Local factors include fracture traits, such as excessive movement, misalignment, and soft tissues caught within fracture ends can lead to delayed or non-union. Infection and reduced blood supply can also lead to poor healing and delayed or non-union. Systemic factors can also predispose to poor healing. Examples include advanced age, obesity, anemia, endocrine conditions, and smoking. Fractures have high mortality and morbidity; therefore, a multi-disciplinary team approach is essential for good outcomes. There are several methods that the team can utilize to stimulate fracture healing. Besides bone graft, bone stimulators and dietary supplements have also been found to be helpful. Bone stimulators can be electrical, electromagnetic, and ultrasound. It is still unclear whether these methods are truly helpful, and this area requires further research. Nutrients to increase in diet include calcium, protein, Vitamins C, and D."
1,101,1,101109,09,pTitle0101109,"Besides aiding the recovery process from bone surgery and certain procedures, bone graft is also commonly used in the dental setting. Bone grafts are used in dentistry for purposes such as teeth saving, extractions, and inplants. When teeth are lost, the bone that used to surround them begins to melt away or “resorb.” Tooth-supporting bone can also be lost from gum disease. If enough teeth and bone are lost, a patient’s facial features will sag, giving a more aged appearance. It can also complicate treatment to replace missing teeth. Fortunately, with modern bone grafting- techniques, the bone that has been lost can be built up again. This can benefit both the patient’s health and appearance by strengthening jawbone and increasing support to facial features. Bone grafting is a minor surgical procedure that is normally done in a dental office. An incision is made in the gum to gain access to the bone beneath it, and then grafting material is added. The procedure for placing a bone graft usually requires only local anesthesia, though oral or IV (intravenous) sedatives can also be used. Grafting material comes in a variety of forms: powder, granules, putty or a gel that can be injected through a syringe. The graft is generally covered by a collagen membrane for optimum bone repair. It will act as a scaffold onto which new bone deposits.
"
1,101,1,101110,10,pTitle0101110,"Much research has been done to improve the efficiency of bone grafting. One method of improving bone-graft healing involves the use of growth factor enhancement. Growth factors are proteins that have a role in controlling biological processes, such as cell growth and differentiation. They also can facilitate tissue repair and regeneration. After binding to specific
cell surface receptors, growth factors can then target cells in a number of ways. They orchestrate the complex sequence of cellular processes during wound healing. There are eight major classes of growth factors that are expressed in varying levels by the cells involved with healing. The effects of each growth factor are regulated through a complex system of feedback loops. Studies have confirmed their ability to enhance the capacity of tissues to regenerate. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is synthesized by platelets and some other cells, has been extensively studied for clinical applications. Scientists have examined their use for bone regeneration, such as in rehabilitation with dental implants. It appears to have broad wound- healing activities in both hard and soft tissue. A naturally occurring protein, it is abundant in bone matrix and is released locally by blood platelets during clotting. Because healing is more rapid, the risk of risks such as infection, dry socket, failed implants, or failed grafting is lower."
1,101,1,101111,11,pTitle0101111,"Bone defects are currently treated with either synthetic substitutes or bone grafts taken from a bone bank or another part of the patient's body. However, these treatments often spark immune rejection and can be quickly outgrown by pediatric patients. Bone grafts generated from patient stem cells overcome such limitations. However, it is difficult to bioengineer these grafts for larger defects. Scientists recently developed a new bone engineering technique to address this limit. The technique allows researchers to combine segments of bone engineered from stem cells. This creates large scale, personalized grafts that will enhance treatment for those suffering from bone disease or injury. The team engineered a graft corresponding to a defect in the femur of a rabbit that affected about 30% of the bone's total volume. They first scanned the femur to assess the size and shape of the defect and generated a model of the graft. They then partitioned the model into smaller segments and created customized scaffolds for each. The team then placed these scaffolds into a special bioreactor. It is specially designed to accommodate bone grafts with a broad range of sizes. This bioreactor was able to ensure uniform development of tissue throughout the graft. Once the cells integrated within the scaffold, the segments of the bone graft could then be combined into a single, stable graft using bone adhesives or other orthopedic devices."

During the surgery, the physician often makes a cut into the bone near the defect where the graft is to be placed. The potential drawbacks of the surgical procedure include chronic pain from the surgical site (e.g., if nerves are inadvertently cut) or rejection of transplants."
1,101,2,101202,02,pTitle0101202,"An allograft is bone or tissue that is transplanted from one person to another. The tissue is often
received directly from donors who have died or from a bone tissue bank. Surgeons use allografts
widely to repair bone, tendons and cartilage in many different surgeries. In the United States,
over 900,000 allografts are harvested each year. The greatest advantage of allografts is to
enhance the quality of life for patients by reducing the number of surgical sites. Athletes who
need to rebuild their knees usually receive allografts to provide the framework for the growth of
fresh bone. Patients suffering from back pain often receive harvested allografts that ensure bone
quality and density. Cancer patients sometimes receive allografts to fill bone loss caused by
tumor surgery. The procedure to prepare the donated bone for transplantation is called
processing. Processing is performed in carefully controlled environments to prevent
contamination or infection. All potential donors are carefully screened for medical histories
before a donation can take place. Most donors are young people who have died in accidents or
from sudden illness. Patients with any history of cancer cannot donate their bones. In most cases,
allografts are very safe and effective. There are cases where the allografts don’t perform as
expected. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including patient age, life style, or medical
condition."
1,101,2,101203,03,pTitle0101203,"In contrast to an allograft, an autograft involves using bone from the same person who received
the graft. Autografts can be harvested from what are considered “non-essential” bones. Theses
bones often include the hip, but never the knees or the spine. If a bone graft involves a bigger
area, which is usually called a “block graft,” surgeons may suggest an autograft to patients for
greater support of bone growth. Because the graft originates from the patient’s own body, the
risk of bone graft rejection is much reduced. However, as in an allograft, an autograft also carries
the risk of chronic pain at the site where the bone tissue was placed. Most commonly, chronic
pain associated with a bone graft transplant is either caused by an injury to a tendon, or to
cartilage or a muscle. Pain may also result if the small nerves near the surgical site are cut. As
the quality of surgical techniques has advanced over the years, the risk of having chronic pain
from autograft surgery has been reduced. Also, given there are a growing variety of effective
alternatives to autograft tissue, such as man-made substances, fewer and fewer medical
procedures (especially spine procedures) include autograft bone harvesting."
1,101,2,101204,04,pTitle0101204,"There are different advantages of using autografts and allografts. Autograft bone is one of the
safest because there is no risk of disease transmission from other donors. Patients from whom an
autograft is harvested commonly have a better chance of accepting the graft, which results in a
more effective transplant to repair and rebuild the diseased bones. Because the bone growing
cells and proteins originate from the patient’s own body, there is reduced risk of rejection. After
the surgery, autograft bone provides a strong framework for the fresh bone to grow into. Because
the autograft substance is living bone, with all the bone cells and proteins that support tissues and
enhance bone formation, new bone growth is ensured. On the other hand, the biggest advantage
of allograft bone is the reduction in the area of surgery. Receiving allograft tissue from another
person means that a second surgery to remove autograft bone, tendon or cartilage from the
patient’s own body, is not necessary. It also reduces the risk of infection, and reduces the pain
because there is no second surgical site for harvesting. Without having the second surgery, it also
reduces the expense for patients. Patients who cannot handle multiple surgeries because of
medical or financial conditions are recommended to receive an allograft."
1,101,2,101205,05,pTitle0101205,"There are different drawbacks of autografts and allografts. Although one of the advantages of an
autograft is the reduced chance of disease transmission, a potential drawback of autograft is that
it involves a second procedure to harvest the bone, which may cause pain at the surgical site
from which the graft is taken. This also increases surgical risks; the second site sometimes takes
a longer period of time to heal than the site of the primary surgery, which can be up to years
longer. It also may not be a best option in cases where the patient's overall bone quality and
density is poor, or when a large area of graft substance is needed. This is because there is a
relatively small amount of bone available for autograft. The final drawback is the additional
financial expense of the second procedure. Drawbacks of allograft bone include the slight chance
of disease transmission and the problem of bone variability because it may be harvested from a
variety of donors. As a result, grafted bone may take longer to grow with the host bone (than in
an autograft). Also, because the bone growth cells and proteins are removed during processing in
an allograft, it is not as effective as an autograft. Sometimes, the patient's immune system may
reject the grafted bone tissue. Patients are recommended to take drugs for reducing the chance of
rejection."
1,101,2,101206,06,pTitle0101206,"One drawback of bone allograft harvesting is the potential risk of disease transmission. Patients
may have concerns about the actual chance of disease transmission in the surgery. An allograft
may be obtained from living donors who are having bone removed during surgery or donors who
had died. There are a variety of allografts including the fresh frozen allograft and the freeze-dried
bone allograft. There have been no cases of disease transmission during the 30-year history of
using freeze-dried bone allografts. However, there have been four cases of HIV infection using
fresh-frozen bone allografts. It is important to note, however, that fresh-frozen allografts are not
commonly used in this surgery. A freeze-dried bone allograft is the primary kind of allograft. Its
processing procedure takes a relatively longer time. It includes additional tests to ensure there is
no risk of disease transmission. Most bone banks follow the guidelines available from the
American Association of Tissue Banks. The guidelines provide a careful screening and
processing procedure of donated bone substances, such as removing proteins. With donor
screening and processing recommendations, the chance of receiving a bone graft from an HIV-
infected donor is one in 1.67 million, a very slight chance. Therefore, the established donor
screening and processing procedures will ensure that bone allografts are safe for bone graft
harvesting."
1,101,2,101207,07,pTitle0101207,"A successful usage of allografts requires a thorough processing procedure. This is to remove any
material that might elicit an immune response, such as bone marrow or pathogens. Allograft is
bone or tissue from one person to another, while an autograft involves using bone from the same
person. Thus, the greatest advantage of allografts is to enhance the quality of life for patients by
reducing the number of surgical sites. However, one drawback of bone allograft harvesting is the
potential risk of disease transmission. In addition, sometimes the patient’s immune system may
reject the grafted bone tissue. To prevent contamination or infection, a process called
decellularization is often used. Decellularizing the bone graft uses a mix of chemical substances,
enzymes, and physical treatment. Common methods can be based on chemical treatment,
sonication, or irradiation. Some methods may result in better conditions for stem cell growth to
integrate the graft. Properties of the bone graft such as surface area and stability may be altered
by the processing of the graft. While these methods may be viewed as the central step in graft
processing, donor screening will also ensure that bone grafts are safe for bone graft harvesting.
Most bone banks follow strict guidelines. As a result, the chance of receiving a bone graft from
an HIV-infected donor is very slight."
1,101,2,101208,08,pTitle0101208,"Besides processing methods, the harvesting of donated bone substances is also a central step to
prevent rejection or infection. Unlike autograft, allograft is bone or tissue that is transplanted
from one person to another. Therefore, one drawback involves the potential risk of disease
transmission. There are several groups that regulate allograft use. They include the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), as well as the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB).
AATB publishes industry standards and offers a thorough process to accredit its members. By
becoming a member under AATB, tissue banks agree to comply with on-site inspections. In
addition, they must follow other safety guidelines to reduce risks. Bone banks exist to provide
the surgeon with safe bone tissue that is high quality and suitable for medical application. Some
goals of bone banking are to preserve the physical properties of the graft and certain chemical
conditions. It also ensures sterility and remove material that might elicit an immune response,
such as bone marrow or pathogens. One common concern is to screen for HIV-infected donor.
As a result, producing an allograft for surgery can take a long period of time through a careful
process. This process begins with donor screening, where donor's history and medical conditions
are important factors."
1,101,2,101209,09,pTitle0101209,"Harvesting an allograft that is safe and suitable for patients requires a careful process. Groups such
as the FDA and AATB publish industry standards and strict safety guidelines to reduce risks. When
a bone bank receives a potential donor’s death, its first step is to determine donor eligibility based
on available information. For example, what is the person's age, cause of death, life style, or
medical condition. If a potential donor can be accepted, the bone bank would need consent from
relatives or caretaker of the donor according to FDA regulations. Next, the bone bank sends a
recovery team to evaluate and procure potential donor tissues. The team assigns a unique tracking
number to the potential donor. After a more thorough screening and additional tests, they must
procure the tissue within 12 hours of death, or within 24 hours for refrigerated cadavers. Lastly,
the harvested tissues are treated with a mix of processing procedures. These are to remove any
material that might elicit an immune response, such as bone marrow or pathogens. Unlike autograft,
allograft is bone or tissue that is transplanted from one person to another. Therefore, one drawback
involves the potential risk of disease transmission. One common concern is to screen for HIV-

potential risk of transmission. There are several disease processes that would make their bone
tissue not suitable for medical application. Unlike autograft, a primary concern for allograft is to
screen for donors tested positive for HIV, with the first case of disease transfer reported in 1988.
Common methods for HIV screening can be based on chemical tests. The recovery team also
screens for a history of IV drug use and evaluate lymph node biopsy. These are all important
factors to exclude before a donation can take place. With proper standards, the chance of receiving
allografts from an HIV-infected donor is greatly reduced. Another risk to exclude is cancer, which
requires a thorough autopsy. Lastly, bacterial and viral infections must also be ruled out, performed
with tests for different pathogens."
1,101,2,101211,11,pTitle0101211,"The most commonly used method to ensure allograft sterility is irradiation. It is believed that
irradiation will prevent HIV transmission, thus making it worthwhile to enhance safety at the
cost of certain material properties of the bone. However, studies have shown that, even at doses

tendons and cartilage, are first harvested from the qualified donors whose medical histories are
carefully screened. Then tissue banks process and freeze the donated bone tissues to ensure that
they are safe to use in the surgeries to prevent the risks of contamination, infection or disease
transmission. Once the donated bones are ready for transplantation, surgeons often make a cut
into the damaged bone and fill the incision with the bone graft. Common areas of bone grafting
include hips, knee and spine. Bone grafts can be applied to people who have fractures caused by
accidents or to people suffering with illness that result in bone loss, such as tumors or cancers.
The advantage of a bone graft is that it provides a framework to support the growth of living
bone cells, as well as new bone cells. However, there is a risk of transplant rejection. Under
certain circumstances, patients may also have chronic pain at the surgical site because of the
inadvertent damage to the nerves during surgery."

The careful screening by the bank reduced the risks of disease transmission. In addition to
rejection of transplants, there is a risk that patients may suffer from chronic pain at the surgical

inserting the graft into the bone. However, bone grafts can enhance bone growth by providing a
framework for bone cells and ensure bone density and quality for patients suffering from bone
loss. Therefore, patients with fractures, tumors or cancers are often recommended to receive
bone grafts.

1,102,1,102101,01,pTitle0102101,"Blood donation is a procedure in which a person agrees to have blood drawn so that it can be used for transfusions or separated into components to make blood products. Millions of people need blood transfusions or blood products each year because of surgery or disease. Given the methods of obtaining blood from a donor, there are different types of donation. The most common way is to take blood from a vein as whole blood. The skin over the vessel from where the blood will be drawn is carefully cleaned. A large needle is used to minimize the shearing forces that can physically damage the red blood cells as they flow through the needle. The blood is usually stored in a flexible plastic bag. Another way is called apheresis, in which the whole blood goes through a special machine to separate it during the donation, so that only certain parts of blood are collected. This allows more of a single component, such as red blood cells, plasma or platelets, to be collected in one sitting. Healthy adults can usually donate a pint of blood without endangering health. The body replaces the lost fluids within 24 hours of a blood donation, and the lost red blood cells within several weeks."
1,102,1,102102,02,pTitle0102102,"Blood banks serve many functions besides collection. They preserve blood by adding a combination of chemicals that keeps the blood from clotting until it is needed. The process through which blood changes from a liquid to a gel is called coagulation, also known as clotting. By adding anticoagulant, such as Heparin, and refrigerating the blood, it is possible to store blood for a relatively long time from days to years depending on the blood component. Another important function of blood banks is to screen for infectious agents. Some infectious agents, such as HIV or Hepatitis, can survive in blood and infect the person receiving the transfusion. The screening process is so effective that the risk of getting HIV from a transfusion is lower than the risk of getting a lightning strike or getting stung by hornets and wasps. Another risk is getting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) from a transfusion. CJD, which is the human version of Mad Cow Disease, is a very rare, yet fatal brain disorder. Because of this, people who may have been exposed to CJD are not eligible blood donors even though the risk is very low.  It is this rigorous testing that keeps the blood supply safe. In addition to preserving and screening blood, some blood banks remove white blood cells to prepare blood for a transfusion. This process is called leukocyte reduction. Although rare, some people are allergic to white blood cells in donated blood. Removing these cells makes allergic reactions less likely."
1,102,1,102103,03,pTitle0102103,"Blood type is a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of inherited substances on the surface of red blood cells. These substances, called antigens, are proteins that can stimulate the production of antibodies. When people who have one blood type receive blood from someone with a different blood type, it may cause the immune system to react. Every person has one of the following blood types: A, B, AB, or O, depending on whether the blood contains the A- or B-antigen, both, or neither. In America, about 40 percent of the population has Type O, but the distribution varies geographically. For example, in Northern India and central Asia, the frequency of Type B is relatively high. Blood Type A is more typical in Europe. People with Type O are called universal donors because this type is safe for almost everyone. Type O is used for emergencies when there's no time to test a person's blood type. People who have type AB blood are called universal recipients because they can get any type of blood. Blood type is also classified as Rh-positive or Rh-negative. If you have Rh-positive blood, you can get Rh-positive or Rh-negative blood. Both blood and plasma transfusions must be matched to avoid an immune reaction. The symptoms of ABO incompatibility include back pain, blood in the urine, chills, fever and yellow skin. Blood type incompatibility can be a very serious problem that can result kidney failure, low blood pressure, and even death."
1,102,1,102104,04,pTitle0102104,"A medical history is taken from potential blood donors to ensure that they are unlikely to have any adverse consequences to a transfusion. Potential donors are asked if they have ever had heart, lung, or blood diseases. In general, people with heart disease, heart valve conditions, irregular heartbeat, disease of the blood vessels in the brain, heart failure, and certain lung conditions are not allowed to donate blood unless this has been cleared with a healthcare provider. People who have undergone recent surgery are permitted to donate blood when healing is complete and they have resumed full activity. However, if a transfusion was given at the time of surgery, donation is not allowed for one year. Women who are pregnant are not permitted to donate blood during, or six weeks after, pregnancy. There are age and weight requirements for blood donation. The minimum age is 16 or 17 years, depending upon the state. The less a donor weighs, the greater the likelihood of having a reaction, such as dizziness and fainting following donation. That is why individuals weighing less than 110 pounds are not permitted to donate blood. There is no upper weight limit for donating blood, although some centers have an upper weight limit based on the size and strength of the donor chair."
1,102,1,102105,05,pTitle0102105,"Some diseases require large amounts of blood for transfusion. For instance, in newborn jaundice, a baby has a high level of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is normally released when old red blood cells are broken down. The liver filters this substance into the intestine so it can be removed from the body in the stool. A newborn’s immature liver sometimes cannot filter the bilirubin quickly enough. High levels of bilirubin make a baby's skin and whites of the eyes look yellow. It is perfectly normal for a baby's bilirubin level to be a bit higher after birth. When the baby is growing in the mother's womb, the placenta removes bilirubin from the baby's body. After birth, the baby's liver starts doing this job. It may take some time for the baby’s liver to be able to do this efficiently. Bilirubin is toxic to the cells of the brain. One risk of severe jaundice is that the bilirubin may pass into the brain, a condition called acute bilirubin encephalopathy. If this condition is prolonged, it can result in permanent brain damage, which is called kernicterus. Jaundice is easy to diagnose, so this rarely happens. Most often, it is treated with phototherapy, but severe cases may require an exchange transfusion."
1,102,1,102106,06,pTitle0102106,"Apheresis is commonly used for extracting individual blood components from whole blood. This procedure can be used to treat certain medical conditions. Apheresis has been considered a safe and effective treatment to selectively remove harmful or disease-provoking substances from the blood. The filtered, clean blood is then returned back to the patient. In many situations, apheresis is an ongoing treatment, so patients need multiple sessions of apheresis over several weeks to be fully cured. Apheresis is suggested for patients with leukemia, multiple myeloma, and other conditions. During therapeutic apheresis, the patient is connected to a blood cell separator machine, which has two or three channels for blood flowing between the body and the machine. After the separation, the unwanted components are discarded and the remaining parts are returned back into the blood. This procedure requires two needles to be inserted into the veins, one in each arm. However, for patients with small or inadequate veins, it may be necessary to insert a catheter into one of the large veins in the neck to allow enough blood flow. Based on the disease being treated, the blood flow rate, and the size of the patient, the procedure can take from one to four hours."
1,102,1,102107,07,pTitle0102107,"The U.S. government eased restrictions on blood donations from gay men and other key groups because of a drop in the nation’s blood supply triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. The Food and Drug Administration’s new policy aims to allow tens of thousands more Americans to give blood, including gay and bisexual men and people with recent tattoos and piercings. Canceled blood drives have decimated donations to the American Red Cross and other nonprofits that provide most of the blood supply. Last month, the Red Cross estimated there had been 86,000 fewer blood donations in recent weeks because blood drives were canceled at workplaces, colleges and other locations. The FDA’s previous rules barred donations from men who have had sex with a man in the previous year. The same policy applied to women who’ve had sex with gay or bisexual men and people who’ve received tattoos and piercings in the past year. Under the new policy, the disqualifying time period was reduced to three months. FDA officials said the move to three months matches recent changes in the United Kingdom and other developed countries. The agency said it expects the changes to remain in place after the pandemic ends. The U.S. and many other countries have long restricted donations from gay and bisexual men and several other groups due to the risk of spreading HIV through the blood supply. In 2015, the FDA moved from a total ban to the one-year abstinence period for men who have sex with men."
1,102,1,102108,08,pTitle0102108,"Acute transfusion reactions present as adverse signs or symptoms during or within 24 hours of a blood transfusion. The most frequent reactions are fever, chills, itchiness, or rash. They typically resolve promptly without specific treatment or complications. Other signs occurring along with a blood transfusion may indicate more severe and potentially fatal reaction. These include severe shortness of breath, red urine, high fever, or coma. Transfusion reactions require immediate care, lab tests, and clinical management. If a transfusion reaction is suspected when giving blood, the safest practice is to stop the transfusion. The intravenous line should be kept in normal saline. A clerical check of the information on the blood unit label and the patient's identity should then be performed. This is to ensure that the ""right"" blood unit was given to the ""right"" patient. In most cases, the residual contents of the blood component container should be returned the blood bank. It is returned together with a freshly collected blood sample from the patient, and a transfusion reaction investigation should be started. Acute transfusion reactions may present in complex clinical situations because it may not be obvious. To diagnose, doctors need to distinguish between a reaction to the transfused blood product and the illness being treated. It could be a coincidence that occurs during or right after a blood transfusion."
1,102,1,102109,09,pTitle0102109,"In the United States, sickle cell anemia is found mainly in the black population. Patients with
sickle cell anemia require repeated red cell transfusions. As a result, they may form multiple
antibodies to common Rh or other blood group antigens. The presence of such antibodies may increase the time required for a transfusion service to supply compatible red cells. If undetected, these red cell antibodies may cause shortened survival of transfused red cells through hemolysis, or rupture of red blood cells. However, severe acute hemolytic reactions are uncommon. In addition, patients with sickle cell anemia may get delayed transfusion reactions. The first clinical signs of these delayed reactions include dark urine. Women with multiple child births may also form antibodies to white cell, red cell, or platelet antigens. Acute transfusion reactions may occur at any age, but at different rates. Newborns do not form antibodies to ABO blood group antigens (anti-A, B, or AB) during the first few months of life. Because of this, ABO-related negative reactions are not observed in this age group. Most blood transfusions are provided to persons aged 60 years and older, so most incidents also occur in this age group. A decline in ABO antibodies after the sixth decade of life reduces the likelihood that the transfusion of red cells incompatible to ABO groups will cause a severe fatal reaction."
1,102,1,102110,10,pTitle0102110,"Acute and severe cases of anemia may require transfusion of packed red blood cells. Anemia is defined as a decrease in the amount of working red blood cells (RBC). Anemia is a common illness that can be caused by low RBC production, excessive RBC destruction, or blood loss. Clinical features, if present, are mostly not specific and may include fatigue, shortness of breath, and high heart rate. Once anemia has been established, the doctor should check the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which is the average volume of a red cell. Knowing which type of anemia based on MCV helps to guide the next steps. Iron deficiency anemia is most common type of anemia, caused by a lack of iron in the body. Bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin, which is the protein that carries oxygen. With low iron, there is not enough hemoglobin for red blood cells. Besides iron, folate and vitamin B-12 are also needed to produce enough healthy red blood cells. A diet lacking in these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood cell production. Aplastic anemia is a rare, life-threatening anemia that occurs when the body doesn't produce enough red blood cells. Causes of aplastic anemia include infections, certain medicines, autoimmune diseases and toxic chemicals. A variety of diseases, such as leukemia, can also cause anemia by affecting blood production in the bone marrow."
1,102,1,102111,11,pTitle0102111,"Jehovah’s Witnesses is a religious group that believes it is against God’s will to receive blood.
Therefore, they refuse blood transfusions, often even if it is their own blood. If they receive
blood at will, it can lead to expulsion from by their church in some cases. However, a minority of
the sect do not agree that the Bible prohibits blood transfusions, so they accept transfusions.
Some Jehovah’s Witnesses may also believe that it is okay to receive blood plasma fractions or
the reinfusion of their own blood. Given the spectrum of beliefs among followers of the religion,
health care providers should assess the view of each patient on this aspect. In the case of elective
surgery, a doctor who believes that a blood transfusion may be necessary may refuse to perform
surgery on a Jehovah’s Witness patient. This is because the patient has already refused to consent
to a blood transfusion. Naturally, the doctor would have to refer such a patient to another doctor,
if the patient still wished to undergo surgery. When treating a child of Jehovah’s Witness
parents, doctors should be aware of possible complex family dynamics. The parents cannot
openly be seen to tell their child to consent to a blood transfusion. They also may not consent on
their child’s behalf, but they might actually welcome a third party consenting on behalf of their
child. If this the case, it will help decision-making on the part of the doctor."

1,102,2,102202,02,pTitle0102202,"Patients may receive a pint of whole blood or just specific components of the blood needed to
treat a particular condition. Whole blood is the human blood from a standard blood donation
without further processing. When only specific components are used, it is called blood
component therapy. Up to four components can be derived from donated blood: red blood cells,
white blood cells, platelets and plasma. Blood component therapy allows several patients to
benefit from one pint of donated whole blood. Different parts of blood serve different functions.
Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a complex protein containing iron that carries oxygen
through the body. Platelets form clots to control bleeding. Plasma, which constitutes about 55%
of blood volume, is the liquid part of the blood that contains antibodies and also helps clotting.
Depending on the parts of blood being obtained, there are different kinds of blood donations.
Apheresis is a medical procedure to collect individual blood components. The process for whole
blood donation usually takes about one hour with the collection itself usually lasting only about
10 minutes. It takes about two hours for the apheresis. The storage of different blood components
may vary from a few days to dozens of years. The storage of whole blood, similar to red blood
cells, can be kept up to 30 days."
1,102,2,102203,03,pTitle0102203,"Red blood cells are the most frequently used blood component and are needed by almost every
type of patient requiring a transfusion. In double red cell donation, twice as many red blood cells
are collected as in a single donation of whole blood. During double red cell donation, blood is
drawn from one arm through a sterile, single-use needle connected to the apheresis machine.
This machine separates and collects two units of red cells. Then, it safely returns the remaining
blood components -- white blood cells, plasma and platelets, along with some saline -- back to
the donor through the same arm. Saline is given to the donor intravenously. Otherwise, the
donor's blood pressure could become low enough to cause light-headedness or even loss of
consciousness. Since the liquid portion of blood is not lost, the donor may feel more hydrated
after donation. However, donors need to meet slightly more stringent criteria in order to be able
to give a double red cell donation. The criteria include higher levels of hemoglobin, as well as
height and weight requirements. People also may be less able to exercise vigorously for a few
days after double red cell donation. This donation takes approximately 30 minutes longer than a
whole blood donation. People can donate approximately every four months. Red blood cells may
be treated and frozen for an extended storage of 10 years or more."
1,102,2,102204,04,pTitle0102204,"Platelets are small colorless blood cells that help the clotting process by sticking to the blood
vessels. Platelets are usually given to people who have too few platelets and are susceptible to
severe and spontaneous bleeding. Because aspirin can impair the clotting of platelets, donors
should not take any products containing aspirin, 48 hours before donation. During a platelet
donation, a small portion of blood, about one fourth of a pint, is drawn at a time. Similar to the
process used in double red cell donation, a machine for apheresis collects the platelets and some
plasma and returns the red cells and most of the plasma back to the donor. The donation takes
approximately two hours. After the donation, donors can resume normal activities that day. A
single platelet donation can provide enough platelets for a full treatment unit for a patient in
need. In fact, some platelet donations yield enough platelets for two or three treatment units. By
contrast, it takes four to six whole blood donations to produce a single treatment unit. Many
patients who need platelets are either patients who have cancer, or who are undergoing surgery
but happen to have weakened immune functions. Instead of obtaining platelets from multiple
donors through whole blood donations, physicians prefer having patients obtaining platelets from
a single donor through platelets donation to reduce risks. Platelets can be stored for only five
days."
1,102,2,102205,05,pTitle0102205,"Plasma, the fluid part of the blood, is 92 percent water and constitutes 55 percent of blood
volume. Plasma serves a variety of functions, from maintaining a healthy blood pressure and
volume to supplying critical proteins for blood clotting and immune functions. During a plasma
donation, blood is drawn by a process called apheresis. The machine for apheresis collects
plasma or a fluid of plasma and platelets, and then safely returns the remaining blood along with
some saline to donors. Plasma and platelet donation can be collected at the same time. Plasma
can potentially be collected once per month. The average donation takes about seventy-five
minutes. Plasma is usually frozen immediately after it is separated from fresh blood in order to
preserve clotting components. Plasma frozen within 24 hours of collection can be stored for up to
one year. It is used for bleeding diseases in which the missing clotting component is unknown or
when the specific clotting component is not available. Plasma also is used when bleeding is
caused by insufficient production of all or many of the different clotting components as a result
of liver disease or severe infection. Type AB plasma is universal which means this type of
plasma can be received by any adults, regardless of blood type."
1,102,2,102206,06,pTitle0102206,"Not only do blood donations vary in terms of the different blood components to be drawn from
the donors, but also in terms of the types of donors. One of the special types of blood donations
is autologous donation. Autologous donations are donations in which individuals give blood for
their own needs. For example, in the weeks before undergoing surgery, a person may donate
several units of blood for transfusion that maybe needed during or after the surgical procedure.
The person takes a supplement of iron after donating the blood to help the body replace the lost
blood cells before surgery. Also, during some types of surgery, blood that is lost can be collected
and immediately given back to the person. An autologous donation reduces the risks of blood
type incompatibility and blood-borne disease. However, it is not used as often as standard
donation. This is because blood products are very safe due to the stringent donor screening. In
addition, elderly patients may not be allowed to donate blood before surgery because they are
more likely to have other health problems during donation. These health problems include low
blood pressure, light-headedness and even loss of consciousness. People are also not allowed to
do autologous donation within three days of their surgery."

from a relative (directed donation) are at increased risk. Red blood cells are the most frequently
used blood component and are needed. They may be irradiated up to 14 days after collection, and
stored for another 14 days. Platelets are small colorless blood cells that help the clotting process
by sticking to the blood vessels. They can be irradiated at any stage in their shelf-life and stored
up five days. The donation of these different blood components is often drawn by a process
called apheresis. The machine for apheresis collects red cells, platelets, or other components, and
then safely returns the remaining blood along with some saline to donors. Another way to
prevent GVHD is autologous donations, in which individuals give blood for their own needs.
However, it is not used as often as standard donation, and elderly patients may not be allowed."
1,102,2,102208,08,pTitle0102208,"Leucodepletion is the process of removing leucocytes (white blood cells) from blood
components using special filters. This is currently the standard practice across many different
kinds of blood donations. It may be performed before storage at the collection center or at the
bedside. All red cells and platelet components usually go through this step before storage. It
includes red cell units of rare blood to be treated and frozen for an extended storage. Clinical
plasma components may also have white blood cells separated out, depending on the collection.
The donation of these different blood components is often drawn by a process called apheresis,
which filters needed components and then returns the remaining blood back to donors. The white
blood cells present in donated blood often play no therapeutic role and may be a cause of adverse
transfusion reactions. As a result, removing them can have a number of potential benefits for
recipients. It reduces risks of low platelet, bacterial infection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD),
etc. The primary cause of GVHD is growth of donor T-lymphocytes in the bone marrow of
susceptible recipients. However, this does not provide the same protection as irradiation against
GVHD. Another way to prevent GVHD is autologous donations, in which patients give blood for
their own needs. Autologous collections are provided as leucodepleted red cells as well."
1,102,2,102209,09,pTitle0102209,"Besides irradiation and leucodepletion, there are several other processes of modified blood
components. Frozen red cells are prepared by adding protective agent before freezing. They may
be frozen for an extended storage of 10 years or more if there is a need for specific units.
Physicians use frozen red cells for unusual blood types or autologous collections when liquid-
preserved blood cannot fulfill demands. Washed red cells are another modified product that
removes unwanted plasma proteins, including antibodies. There will be some loss of red cells.
This is given to patients who require red cells with a low protein content. They include those
with reactions to transfused plasma proteins, severe allergies, etc. Some red cell and platelet
donations are screened by for the presence of a virus called CMV. Removing white cells offer a
high level of safety in preventing CMV, but not all the time. The transmission of CMV disease is
only from cellular component, so donations made into fresh frozen plasma and other plasma-
derived blood products do not require CMV screening. CMV negative products should be used
for pregnant women and several other groups of patients. Usually, the donation of these different
blood components is drawn by a process called apheresis, which filters needed components and
then returns the remaining blood back to donors. These various processes and stringent donor
screening reduce adverse reactions and blood-borne disease."
1,102,2,102210,10,pTitle0102210,"There are different types of red cell substitutes currently being studied for use in transfusion
medicine. The goal is to enhance the oxygen-carrying capacity for patients suffering from acute
anemia due to blood loss. Normal red blood cells contain hemoglobin (Hb), a complex protein
containing iron that carries oxygen through the body. It is one of the most frequently used blood
components needed by patients. Usually, the donation of these different blood components is
drawn by a process called apheresis. It filters needed components and then returns the remaining
blood back to donors. Red cells can be washed or frozen depending on the need. However, when
patients refuse blood donation or blood is not available, red cell substitutes can be used. They
have shown promise to fulfill special demands, at the same time reducing adverse reactions and
blood-borne diseases. For instance, Hb-Based Oxygen Carriers are purified Hb where parts of
the molecule have been modified. This increases the oxygen-releasing ability of the Hb proteins.
They can be infused without prior screening, and open the door to plasma oxygen delivery. This
has advantages over red blood cells because they can reach tissues where normal cells are not
able to pass. They are also available as stable formulations with extended storage."
1,102,2,102211,11,pTitle0102211,"The role of blood banks in providing therapeutic products has evolved within recent years. New
and improved blood components and alternate uses for products have shown promise to fulfill
special demands. For instance, Hemoglobin (Hb)-Based Oxygen Carrier is a modified Hb
molecule that increases the oxygen-releasing ability. There are also different types of platelet
substitutes currently being studied for use in transfusion medicine. Platelets are small colorless
blood cells that help the clotting process by sticking to the blood vessels. The goal is to enhance
the clotting ability of patients with too few platelets and are susceptible to severe bleeding. For
example, Infusible Platelet Membranes (IPMs) are made from old platelet units. Small particles
form in a spontaneous way from a platelet during collection and processing of components. They
appear to have the ability to function as a platelet and help to form a primary plug. One use for
IPMs may be in patients who do not respond well to platelet transfusions. They can also be used
for whom finding compatible platelet pheresis donors is difficult. However, it does not have the
advantage of an extended storage. Similar to the process used in red cell donation, platelet blood
components is drawn by a process called apheresis. It filters needed components and then returns
the remaining blood back to donors."

The most common way is to take blood from a vein as whole blood. The skin over the vessel from where the blood will be drawn is carefully cleaned.

1,103,1,103101,01,pTitle0103101,"A cornea transplant is a surgical procedure to replace part of your cornea with tissue from a donor. The procedure is also called a keratoplasty. The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped surface of your eye. The cornea accounts for a large part of your eye's focusing power with multiple layers of tissue. In fact, the cornea has three different layers. The outermost layer is called the epithelium. The innermost layer is the endothelium. Sitting between the epithelium and the endothelium is the stroma. Interestingly, these layers have no blood vessels, so the cornea is nourished by absorbing oxygen from tears. A transplant doesn’t always involve all the layers. The procedure that transplants all the layers of the cornea is called a penetrating cornea transplant. The procedure that replaces only some of the layers of cornea is called lamellar cornea transplant. Both penetrating and lamellar transplants can restore vision, reduce pain and improve the appearance of a damaged cornea. Most corneas used in transplants come from deceased donors. There are more people requesting that their corneas be available for donation after they die, relative to other organs such as livers or kidneys. Hence, people needing cornea transplants generally will not endure long waits."

It is an uncommon condition in which the normally round and clear cornea becomes thin and develops a cone-like bulge. Keratoconus literally means “cone-shaped cornea.” The cause of keratoconus is still not known. Some researchers believe that genetics play a role, since an estimated 10 percent of people with keratoconus also have a family member with the condition. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes, though symptoms in each eye may differ. Symptoms usually start to occur in people who are in their late teens. The rate of progression varies. It will often progress slowly for 10 to 20 years and then suddenly stop. The symptoms include blurring and distortion of vision, increased sensitivity to light, glare and mild eye irritation. An ophthalmologist will be able to diagnose keratoconus during a routine eye exam. There are different eye exams. A slit lamp, which is an instrument with high-intensity light, can be used to diagnose severe cases of keratoconus, but corneal topography is needed to diagnose the more subtle cases. There are additional procedures to determine the shape of the cornea, including the computerized corneal mapping. This procedure is used to take a picture of the cornea and generate a topographical map of your eye's surface."
1,103,1,103103,03,pTitle0103103,"Patients with Fuchs' dystrophy usually need a cornea transplant. Fuchs' dystrophy is an eye disease in which cells lining the inner surface of the cornea slowly start to die off. The disease usually affects both eyes. It can be inherited, and if either of your parents has the disease, you have a 50% chance of developing the condition. However, the condition may also occur in persons without a known family history of the disease. Fuchs' dystrophy is more common in women than in men. Vision problems usually do not appear before age 50, although doctors may be able to see signs of the disease in affected persons by their 30s or 40s. The thin layer of cells that line the back part of the cornea help pump excess fluid out of the cornea. As more and more cells are lost in Fuchs’ dystrophy, fluid begins to build up, causing swelling in the cornea and causing it to become cloudy. At first, fluid may build up only during sleep, when the eye is closed. As the disease gets worse, small blisters may form. The blisters get bigger and may eventually break, causing eye pain. Because Fuchs' dystrophy can cause the shape of the cornea to change, it can lead to permanent vision problems if not treated."

While both Type I and Type II herpes can spread to the eye and cause infection, Type I is by far the most frequent cause of eye infections. Type I herpes is very contagious and is commonly transmitted by skin contact with someone who has the virus. Almost everyone is exposed to Type I herpes, usually during childhood. After the original infection, the virus lies in a dormant state, living in nerve cells of the skin or eye. Reactivation can be triggered in a number of ways, including stress, sun exposure, fever, menstruation, trauma to the body and certain medications. The symptoms of herpes keratitis may include pain, redness, blurred vision, tearing, discharge and sensitivity to light. Treatment of herpes keratitis depends on its severity. Mild infection is typically treated with topical and sometimes oral antiviral medication. Doctors may gently scrape the affected area of the cornea to remove the diseased cells.

1,103,1,103105,05,pTitle0103105,"People who have cataract surgery sometimes experience complications including bleeding, increasing pressure inside the eye, retinal detachment, and swelling of the cornea. Therefore, there is a risk of needing a cornea transplant after cataract surgery. Before the cataract surgery, physicians will measure the curve of the cornea with a technique called keratometry, in which a circle of light is focused on the cornea, and the reflection is used to determine the curve of the cornea. The most common procedure used for removing cataracts is called phacoemulsification. In this procedure, a small incision is made in the side of the cornea. The physician inserts a tiny instrument that uses high-frequency ultrasound to break up the center of the cloudy lens and carefully suctions it out. After the cloudy lens has been removed, the surgeon will replace it with an intraocular lens, an implant made of plastic, silicone, or acrylic. This new, clear lens allows light to pass through and focus properly on the retina. This artificial lens then becomes a permanent part of the eye. The artificial lens is inserted behind the iris, the colored part of the eye. When it is in place, the surgeon closes the incision, either with stitches or surgical glue. In the rare instance in which the cornea is damaged during this process, a transplant is necessary."
1,103,1,103106,06,pTitle0103106,"A synthetic cornea has been recently developed as a substitute to use in a transplant. When it is used in a patient's eye, it encourages damaged cells to rebuild and colonize the new tissue. This new cornea was developed by scientists in Sweden, Canada and California. The scientists made the artificial cornea from collagen, a common connective tissue found in tendons, ligaments, and other parts of the human body. By using synthetic collagen, the researchers eliminated the need for corneas from donors, which can sometimes be in short supply. During the testing, the scientists inserted the synthetic cornea into the eyes of ten patients after removing their diseased tissue. After two years, a majority of the patients' own healthy cells had fully covered the synthetic cornea. With the artificial corneas, their vision had been much improved. The new corneas even produced tears and responded to touch. The risk of cornea rejection is not trivial, occurring in about one in five cases. Having the synthetic cornea merged with the original cells reduces the risk of rejection to a large extent. Synthetic implantations also avoid the risk of diseases that could be transmitted in donor tissue such as hepatitis, AIDS and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is a degenerative brain disorder that leads to dementia and death."
1,103,1,103107,07,pTitle0103107,"A superficial scratch to the eye's outermost epithelial cell layer is the most common corneal
injury. It typically heals in a few days without lasting implications. But when it doesn't heal,
there can be persistent irritation and pain, scarring and potentially vision loss. Scientists found a
kind of a lipid that helps skin injuries heal appears to also aid repair of corneal injuries. It has an
effect even when other conditions, like diabetes, make healing difficult. Their findings show that
the lipid DOPG aids healing of scratches on the cornea from trauma. Causes can include finger
pokes or mascara wands. These results were observed in human cornea cells grown in a
laboratory dish. They are also seen in healthy mice and mice whose healing ability was
compromised. The corneal epithelial cells, which are stacked like a protective brick wall at the
front of the eye, appears to have the same signaling pathway that prompts production of the
parent lipid in skin. The findings indicate a topical application of DOPG may help patients,
possibly even adding it to existing eye drop products. This could one day aid healing of this
important protective barrier after injury as well as after common eye procedures like cataract
surgery. The scientists say that their next three years of new studies, enabled by the grant, should
pave the way for clinical trials."
1,103,1,103108,08,pTitle0103108,"Researchers have developed a device that moves fluids over corneal cells similarly to the
movement of tears over a blinking eye. They hope their findings will help improve ophthalmic
drug development and testing, and advance understanding of how blinking affects the corneal
surface. One way scientists test ophthalmic drugs is to administer them into rabbit's eyes. But
rabbits blink much less than humans, so drugs have more of a chance to permeate the rabbit's
cornea and enter into the eye. Alternatively, scientists use tiny wells containing human corneal
cells. But here also, the cells aren't exposed to the normal environment of a living human eye.
Kyoto University scientists collaborated to develop a device that overcomes these issues. They
3D-printed a device that contains four upper and four lower channels, separated by a clear porous
membrane. Corneal cells are incubated in each upper channel on top of the membrane. After
seven days, they form a barrier of cells that separates the upper and lower channels. Fluid is then
moved through the device to emulate the pressure exerted on one side of the cornea by a blinking
eyelid and moving tears, and on the other side by the fluid of the inner eye. Interestingly, they
found that this movement changed the shape of the cells and increased the production of
filaments. Filaments are known for keeping corneal cells flexible and elastic."
1,103,1,103109,09,pTitle0103109,"Dry eye is commonly caused by certain abnormalities in the tear fluid. The condition leads to dry
areas on the cornea, the eye surface and the transparent outer layer of the eye. Gradually, if the
lack of tears continues, it can lead to disabling eye pain and sensitivity to light in worse cases.
Also dubbed as dry eye syndrome, the condition is common and often a chronic problem,
especially in older people. Commonly, doctors prescribe artificial tears to provide relief for dry
eye syndrome. Now, a team of researchers in Chicago had identified the presence of an antibody,
known as ACPA, in human tears. This is the first time that researchers have shown that patients
with dry eye disease experienced relief and decreased signs and symptoms of the illness when
they tried a new eye drop treatment. The team used pooled human antibodies that target ACPAs
on the patients and has shown efficacy in battling dry eye syndrome. Though the study is still in
its early stage clinical trial, it shows promise and may lead to the formulation of a commercially-
available and effective eye drops for patients. They tried the eye drops on 27 participants with
severe dry eye disease. Participants were divided into two groups. One was given eye drops
made from pooled antibodies. The other group was given the same instructions, but they will use
the eye drops without the antibodies. Those with antibody-based eye drops had reduced corneal
damage than those in the control group."

in contact lenses is risky and can lead to infections, or in some cases, permanent damage. Falling
asleep, or even napping, without removing your contact lenses can greatly increase the likelihood
of serious health problems."
1,103,1,103111,11,pTitle0103111,"When a person has a severely damaged cornea, a corneal transplant is required. Many scientists
have put their efforts in developing an artificial cornea for patients waiting for a donation. The
existing artificial cornea uses man-made collagen or with material such as synthetic polymer.
Therefore, it does not incorporate well with the eye or is not transparent after the cornea implant.
Engineers have recently 3D printed an artificial cornea using the bioink which is made of corneal
stroma and stem cells. Because this cornea is made of corneal tissue-derived bioink, it is
biocompatible. The research team used shear stress generated in the 3D printing to make the
corneal lattice pattern. In the 3D printing process, the ink in the printer comes out through a
nozzle. When it passes through the nozzle, frictional force which then produces shear stress
occurs. They produced transparent artificial cornea with the lattice pattern of human cornea by
regulating the shear stress to control the pattern of collagen fibrils. The research team also
observed that the collagen fibrils remodeled along with the printing path create a lattice pattern
similar to the structure of native human cornea after 4 weeks in vivo. Thus, this approach can
achieve the criteria for both transparency and safety of engineered cornea stroma. It will give
hope to many patients suffering from cornea related diseases"
1,103,2,103201,01,pTitle0103201,"A cornea transplant is a surgical procedure to replace part of your cornea with tissue from a donor. The procedure is also called a keratoplasty. The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped surface of your eye. The cornea accounts for a large part of your eye's focusing power with multiple layers of tissue. In fact, the cornea has three different layers. The outermost layer is called the epithelium. The innermost layer is the endothelium. Sitting between the epithelium and the endothelium is the stroma. Interestingly, these layers have no blood vessels, so the cornea is nourished by absorbing oxygen from tears. A transplant doesn’t always involve all the layers. The procedure that transplants all the layers of the cornea is called a penetrating cornea transplant. The procedure that replaces only some of the layers of cornea is called lamellar cornea transplant. Both penetrating and lamellar transplants can restore vision, reduce pain and improve the appearance of a damaged cornea. Most corneas used in transplants come from deceased donors. There are more people requesting that their corneas be available for donation after they die, relative to other organs such as livers or kidneys. Hence, people needing cornea transplants generally will not endure long waits."
1,103,2,103202,02,pTitle0103202,"Whether the corneal transplant involves a penetrating or lamellar procedure, it is often done on
an outpatient basis in which patients enter the hospital a few hours prior to surgery and leave that
same day. Patients generally leave the hospital a few hours after the surgery. Local or general
anesthesia can be used for this procedure to reduce pain. The entire procedure is done under a
microscope. A circular instrument that looks something like a tiny cookie cutter is used to
remove the layers from the center of the diseased cornea. This is a very precise instrument that
can cut through only the layers that are needed. So for example, if the endothelium is
substantially healthy, a lamellar keratoplasty can be used to replace just the diseased stroma and
epithelium. The surgery can even be done replacing only the endothelium, which is the
innermost layer. The donor tissue is usually sewn in place with extremely fine nylon sutures.
Because the cornea has no blood supply, the transplant heals relatively slowly. That is why
sutures are left in place for a long time, usually three months to one year, but sometimes, they are
left in permanently. Vision gradually improves as the new cornea heals. There is often useful
vision within a few weeks. However, in some cases, it may take several months to a year to
recover full focusing power."
1,103,2,103203,03,pTitle0103203,"The different procedures for corneal transplants actually require very different techniques. With
the penetrating keratoplasty, in which all three layers are replaced, nylon sutures are always used
to hold the tissue in place. Sutures are also used in a lamellar keratoplasty when only the
outermost and middle layers have to be replaced. When the endothelium (innermost) layer is the
only layer that is diseased, patients can benefit from a lamellar keratoplasty to replace just the
endothelium tissue. This is called an endothelial keratoplasty. In this surgery, the abnormal inner
tissue of the cornea is removed. A thin disc containing a layer of healthy endothelium cells from
a donor is placed underneath the stroma of the cornea. In this case, sutures are not used. Instead,
the surgeon uses a tiny needle to inject an air bubble that pushes the donated cell layer into place
underneath the cornea. After the surgery, the air bubble sits in place and the new tissue heals
around it. This is a relatively new technique that has been shown to lead to faster recovery and
fewer complications because the healthy layers can be left in place. What was once a technically
difficult procedure has now become a quite routine type of keratoplasty."
1,103,2,103204,04,pTitle0103204,"The epithelium, the outermost layer of the cornea, stops matter from entering the eye. It is about
only 10% of the total thickness of the cornea. The epithelium contains six extremely thin layers
of tissue. These layers consist of fast-growing and easily regenerated cells that are kept moist
with tears. There are three different functions of the epithelium. First, as above, it serves to
prevent matter from outside the body from entering the other layers of the cornea (i.e., the
endothelium and the stroma), thereby protecting the eye. Second, it functions as a smooth surface
that absorbs oxygen and cell nutrients from tears, and distributes these nutrients to the other
places of the cornea to keep it healthy. Third, it functions as a quite significant component of the
total focusing power of the eye, so damage to the epithelium can severely reduce visual
acuity. The epithelium actually benefits from thousands of tiny nerve endings that make it
extremely sensitive to pain when scratched, thus reducing the likelihood of severe injury.
Different from the endothelium, the epithelium has the power to regenerate, so that it can recover
from damage. Therefore, the surgery is not always required to replace this layer if it is only
slightly scratched. If the epithelium is diseased and is not able to heal gradually, both penetrating
keratoplasty and lamellar keratoplasty can be used."
1,103,2,103205,05,pTitle0103205,"The stroma, which is the middle layer of the cornea, is the thickest layer. It is about 90% of the
cornea's total thickness. It consists primarily of water (78%) and collagen (16%), and like the
other layers of the cornea, contains no blood vessels. When light enters the eye, it first contacts
the outermost layer, the epithelium, which has a smooth surface to help focus the light. The light
then enters the stroma, which has thick layers of tissue to help conduct the light. The stroma has
approximately 200 layers of collagen tissue, which gives the cornea its strength and elasticity,
but also keeps the cornea transparent and light-conducting. The stroma consists of regularly
arranged collagen fibers along with sparsely distributed keratocytes. Keratocytes are specialized
fiber cells in the stroma that play a significant role in keeping the cornea transparent. They also
serve to heal slight damage of stroma. If there is severe damage to the collagen fibers,
keratoplasty surgery is required, especially if the keratocytes are damaged. Depending on the
thickness of diseased layers, the surgeon technically can remove only some layers of the stroma
and keep the healthy ones in place. This type of surgery is a kind of lamellar keratoplasty.
Replacing only some of the layers of cornea will reduce the risk relative to the penetrating
keratoplasty. Because the stroma is very thick, patients can benefit from the lameller keratoplasty
in most of the cases."
1,103,2,103206,06,pTitle0103206,"The endothelium, the innermost layer of the cornea, is a single layer of cells. Like the epithelium
(which is the outermost layer), the endothelium is a thin layer of tissue. The cells are significant
in keeping the cornea clear. Normally, fluid leaks slowly from inside the eye into the middle
layer, the stroma. The main function of the endothelium is to pump this excess fluid out of the
stroma. Without this pumping action, the stroma would swell with water, become hazy, and
ultimately not transparent, which would reduce vision. In a healthy eye, a perfect balance is
maintained between the fluid moving into the cornea and fluid being pumped out of the cornea.
Once the cells are damaged by disease or injury, they are lost forever. Unlike the epithelium, its
cells do not regenerate or restore. In other words, the damaged endothelium cannot recover
through healing itself. Instead, the cells of the endothelium stretch to compensate for dead cells
so that they cover the area. This reduces the pumping function of the endothelium because the
total cell density is reduced. If the endothelium can no longer maintain the fluid balance, the
stroma will lose its primary function of being light-conducting and transparent, thereby
impairing vision. Surgery, such as endothelial keratoplasty, which is a type of lamellar
keratoplasty, is required to replace the diseased endothelium for maintaining visual acuity."
1,103,2,103207,07,pTitle0103207,"Diseased endothelium can result from a variety of causes, which lead to swelling of the stroma
and epithelium. The main function of this innermost layer is to pump this excess fluid out of the
stroma. Without this pumping action, the stroma would swell with water, become hazy, and not
transparent, which would reduce vision. In these conditions where the corneal endothelium is
damaged, it is possible to replace the Descemet's membrane (DM) with endothelial keratoplasty
(EK). DM is the basement membrane that lies between the stroma and the outermost layer of the
cornea. The major benefit of endothelial transplant is that it maintains the structural integrity of
the eye. Modern EK procedures have evolved rapidly with better techniques and knowledge of
posterior corneal anatomy. They have been shown to lead to faster recovery and fewer
complications because the healthy layers can be left in place. Descemet's stripping EK (DSEK)
and Descemet's membrane EK (DMEK) have replaced penetrating keratoplasty where possible.
All EK procedures can cause cell loss related when doctors prepare, insert, and attach of the
donor tissue. Hence, it is important that donors with good cell counts, at least 2300 cells/mm2
are selected. Vision gradually improves as the new cornea heals. There is often useful vision
within a few weeks. However, in some cases, it may take several months to a year to recover full
focusing power."
1,103,2,103208,08,pTitle0103208,"Although there is a learning curve in transitioning from penetrating keratoplasty to Descemet's
Stripping EK (DSEK), many surgeons have taken to DSEK rapidly. Donor tissue preparation
remains a critical step in DSEK. Donor tissues with high endothelial cell counts of 2500–3000
cells/mm2 and from young donors are often selected. Methods to prepare the donor tissue
include manual dissection or with laser. Precut donor tissues have become available through
many eye banks. A thin disc containing a layer of healthy endothelium cells from a donor is
placed under the stroma of the cornea. In this case, sutures are not used. Instead, the surgeon uses
a tiny needle to inject an air bubble that pushes the donated cell layer into place underneath the
cornea. To insert the disc into the anterior chamber, the entry wound size has seen a rapid decline
from 9 mm, to 5 mm or even 3 mm. Reduction in size of incision involves folding of the donor
corneal tissue either in two unequal halves or rolling into a loose roll. Vision gradually improves
as the new cornea heals, with faster recovery and fewer complications because the healthy layers
can be left in place. There is often useful vision within a few weeks. If the attached graft fails to
clear even after 2 weeks, it is known as primary graft failure. This is usually caused by unhealthy
donor epithelium or traumatic operative technique."
1,103,2,103209,09,pTitle0103209,"Descemet's Membrane EK (DMEK) overcomes the major disadvantage of Descemet's Stripping
EK (DSEK), which is the additional stroma that causes farsightedness. The uptake of DMEK by
corneal surgeons has not been as rapid as DSEK because of a steep learning curve and
difficulties in handling the very thin and friable Descemet's membrane. DMEK tissue is made of
DM only. It is the basement membrane that lies between the stroma and the outermost layer of
the cornea. The donor tissue preparation technique is usually manual dissection. As the DM is
firmly attached in young donors’ cornea, surgeons tend to harvest DMEK tissue from eyes above
50 years of age only. In theory, increased donor age reduces the cell viability of the graft in the
patient’s eye. DMEK has higher rates of primary graft failure and cell loss than DSEK. Tissue
preparation where some stroma is retained for structural support have been tried. To insert the
disc into the anterior chamber, surgeons use devices that carries the tissue with minimal damage
to the endothelium. Several devices can be used ranging from conventional lens inserters to glass
tubes. Vision gradually improves as the new cornea heals, with faster recovery and fewer
complications because the healthy layers can be left in place. DMEK has better visual outcomes
in terms of contrast visual acuity than DSEK."
1,103,2,103210,10,pTitle0103210,"Pre-Descemet's EK (PDEK) is another procedure of endothelial keratoplasty, where the pre-
descemet's layer (PDL) along with descemet's membrane (DM) and endothelium is transplanted.
DM is the basement membrane that lies between the stroma and the outermost layer of the
cornea. Normally, surgeons use a whole cornea or parts of the five layers of the cornea to
perform transplant surgery. In 2013, a new sixth layer between the stroma and the DM was
named the Dua's layer. In the PDEK technique, doctors take the innermost two layers of the
cornea, along with the Dua's layer and graft it in the patient's eye. Since it is harvested from all
ages, the limitation of donor age is reduced. The donor tissue preparation technique of PDEK
involves injection of air using a thin needle into the stroma. The PDEK graft is then placed in an
injector. The injector is inserted into the entry wound and the graft is injected in the anterior
chamber. Vision gradually improves as the new cornea heals, with faster recovery and fewer
complications because the healthy layers can be left in place. Like all EK procedures, it can
cause cell loss related when doctors prepare, insert, and attach of the donor tissue. However, cell
loss during donor tissue preparation is less in PDEK than DMEK. As it is a new procedure, graft
failure rates and outcomes are yet to be published."
1,103,2,103211,11,pTitle0103211,"Lamellar keratoplasty offers many advantages and reduces the major risks from penetrating
keratoplasty (PK). It replaces the diseased endothelium for maintaining visual acuity.Rates of
primary graft failure is low, and the eye structure is stronger due to the support of the pre-
descemet's layer (PDL). Membrane junction weakness are reduced in EK, as the entry wound is
very small. These techniques have been shown to lead to faster recovery with the healthy layers
left in place. The need for sutures is also minimal or not at all. The surgeon uses a tiny needle to
inject an air bubble that pushes the donated cell layer into place underneath the cornea. After the
surgery, the air bubble sits in place and the new tissue heals around it. The EK procedures have
evolved rapidly from Descemet's Stripping EK (DSEK) to Descemet's Membrane EK (DMEK).
Pre-Descemet's EK (PDEK) has also emerged as another viable procedure of EK. Here, the PDL
along with descemet's membrane (DM) is transplanted. Donor tissue preparation can be different
across procedures, with different age limitations. However, it is important that donors with good
cell counts are selected. Although there is a learning curve in transitioning from penetrating

supply by both the hepatic artery and portal vein. The majority of the blood comes from the
portal vein, which branches off into capillaries. The liver is mainly composed of cells called
hepatocytes. It also has other types of cells, including cells that line its blood vessels and bile
ducts. The bile ducts carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder or directly to the intestines. Bile
is particularly important for fat absorption. The liver provides many important functions to
sustain life. It breaks down and stores many of the nutrients absorbed from the intestine that the
body needs to function. Some nutrients must be metabolized in the liver before they can be used
for energy or to build and repair body tissues. It also breaks down alcohol, drugs, and toxic
wastes in the blood, which are then eliminated through urine and stool. Lastly, the liver makes
most of the clotting factors that prevents over-bleeding from a cut or injury. Therefore, failure to
process and eliminate these substances can harm the body."
1,104,1,104103,03,pTitle0104103,"Patients with liver cancer often has cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is a condition caused by chronic damage
to the liver, most commonly due to excessive alcohol consumption or viral infection. Subsequent
repair can lead to scarring and abnormal tissues, which leads to dysfunction. Before treating the
cancer, doctors need to understand how well the liver is working. The Child-Pugh score
measures liver function in people with cirrhosis. This system looks at 5 factors, 3 of which are
results collected from blood tests. The first factor is blood levels of bilirubin. Bilirubin is broken
down from red blood cells, and it is the substance that can cause jaundice, or yellowing of the
skin and eyes. The second factor is blood levels of albumin, which is a major protein normally
produced inside the liver. The third factor is prothrombin time, which measures how effectively
the liver is making blood clotting factors. The fourth factor is whether there is fluid accumulation
in the abdomen. The fifth factor is whether the liver disease is affecting brain function. Based on
these factors, three classes of liver function can be categorized. If all these factors are normal,
then liver function is labeled class A. Mild abnormalities are class B, and severe abnormalities
are class C. People with liver cancer and class C cirrhosis are often too sick for major cancer
treatments."
1,104,1,104104,04,pTitle0104104,"Many liver cancers could be prevented by reducing exposure to known risk factors for this
disease. Worldwide, the most significant risk factor for liver cancer is chronic infection with
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). These viruses can spread from person to
person through sharing contaminated needles, such as in drug use. They can also spread through
unprotected sex and through childbirth. Some liver cancers may be avoided by not sharing
needles and by using safer sex practices. An example of safe sex is to always use condoms. The
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all children get the
HBV vaccine. HBV vaccine can help to reduce the risk of hepatitis and liver cancer.
Unfortunately, there is no vaccine for HCV. Preventing HCV infection, as well as HBV infection
in people who have not been immunized, is based on understanding how these infections occur.
Blood transfusions were once a major source of hepatitis infection as well. Nowadays, blood
banks in the United States test donated blood to look for these viruses. As a result, the risk of
getting a hepatitis infection from a blood transfusion is extremely low. People at high risk for
HBV or HCV should be tested for these infections so they can be watched for liver disease and
treated if needed."
1,104,1,104105,05,pTitle0104105,"Not all abnormal growth in the liver indicates cancer. In fact, sometimes these abnormal growths
are merely benign tumors that show up as incidental findings. While they can grow large enough
to cause problems, they do not typically infiltrate into nearby tissues or affect distant body parts
like malignant cancers do. People across age groups can present with benign tumors, but young
women in particular are more susceptible. The most common type of benign liver tumor is called
hemangioma, originating in blood vessels. Most hemangiomas tend to be asymptomatic, but
some may bleed and need to be addressed by surgeons. Hepatic adenoma is another kind of
benign tumor derived from hepatocytes, the main type of liver cell. Most incidents of hepatic
adenoma are asymptomatic as well, but some eventually cause pain in the abdomen. There is
also a slight risk that the tumor could rupture and lead to severe bleeding, and rarely it could
even progress into actual cancer. Thus, experts generally advise getting rid of the tumor if
possible. Taking certain drugs may increase the risk of growing these tumors. Women have a
higher likelihood of growing one of these tumors if they take birth control pills, although this is
rare. Men who use anabolic steroids may also develop these tumors. Adenomas may shrink when
these drugs are discontinued."
1,104,1,104106,06,pTitle0104106,"A large observational study shows eating more whole-grain foods may be linked to a lower risk
of getting liver cancer. The researchers, from the US and China, looked at health records of
125,455 people from the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. As
part of these studies, participants filled out questionnaires every 4 years about their diets. After a
follow-up period of about 24 years, 141 participants had been diagnosed with hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer in adults. Eating more whole grains
was linked with a lower risk of HCC. The researchers also found that eating more bran and
cereal fiber was possibly linked with lower HCC risk, although they didn’t find a link with fruit
or vegetable fiber. This was an observational study, meaning it found a link between two things –
eating more whole grains and having a lower risk of liver cancer – but it didn’t prove that one
definitely caused the other. However, the American Cancer Society already recommends
choosing whole grains instead of refined grain products as part of a healthy diet to reduce cancer
risk, heart disease, and diabetes. People can also add whole grains to your diet by choosing
quinoa or bulgur instead of regular couscous. Add barley or bulgur to soups, and eat popcorn
without added salt and butter for a good whole-grain snack."
1,104,1,104107,07,pTitle0104107,"Although several risk factors for liver cancer have been discovered, their exact mechanism to
make normal liver cells cancerous is only partially understood. Some of these risk factors affect
the DNA of cells in the liver, which can result in abnormal cell growth. DNA is the chemical in
every individual cell that carries the genes controlling cell function. Genes that help cells to
proliferate and stay alive are called oncogenes. Genes that keep cell division under control, repair
mistakes in DNA, or cause cells to die properly are called tumor suppressor genes. Certain
chemicals that cause liver cancer, such as aflatoxins, are known to damage the DNA in liver
cells. For instance, studies have shown that aflatoxins can damage the TP53 tumor suppressor
gene. This gene normally prevents cells from growing excessively. Damage to the TP53 gene
thereby leads to increased abnormal cells and formation of cancers. Hepatitis viruses can also
change DNA when they infect liver cells. In some patients, the virus's DNA can insert itself into
a liver cell's DNA, where it may turn on the cell's oncogenes. Liver cancer clearly has many
different causes. There is undoubtedly a wide array of genes involved in its progression. A more
complete understanding of how liver cancers emerge will help physicians innovate ways to better
prevent and treat them."
1,104,1,104108,08,pTitle0104108,"Liver cancer is the fastest growing cause of cancer death in the United States. The increase is
mainly among adults who have less education, especially men, according to a new study by the
American Cancer Society (ACS). The surveillance research at the ACS reported that the risk of
dying from liver cancer is about twice as likely for those without a college degree compared to
those with one. The research team reviewed the patients' education level and whether they had an
HCV infection. Researchers analyzed data from the National Center for Health Statistics. They
looked at liver cancer death rates in people ages 25 to 74 from 2000 to 2015. During the 15 years
studied, death rates from liver cancer increased 48.6% in men and 34.7% in women. In men, the
increase was only among those who did not have a college degree. In women, deaths increased
across all education levels. However, the rates were generally steeper for those lacking a college
degree. The authors said this information underscores the need for targeted efforts in high-risk
populations. Some goals are to reduce obesity, alcohol consumption, type 2 diabetes, and
improve hepatitis C testing and treatment. Previous studies have shown that death rates were
higher in areas where most people have limited resources. This study is the first to use an
individual’s education level to understand recent trends in liver cancer death rates."
1,104,1,104109,09,pTitle0104109,"Some of the most common symptoms of liver cancer are unintended weight loss, decreased
appetite, and nausea or vomiting. An affected person might also present with an enlarged liver,
felt as fullness underneath the ribs on the right side. There may be swelling or fluid accumulated
in the abdomen as well. Other symptoms can include fever, enlarged veins on the belly that are
noticeable through the skin, and abnormal bruising or bleeding. Certain liver tumors produce
hormones affecting organs other than the liver. These hormones may increase blood calcium
levels, which can cause confusion, constipation, or muscle problems. These hormones might also
cause low blood glucose, breast enlargement, elevated red blood cells, and high cholesterol
levels. Manifesting these symptoms does not necessarily mean someone has liver cancer. In fact,
many of these symptoms are more likely to be resulted from other conditions. Still, if a person
has any of these symptoms, it’s important to have them checked by a doctor to narrow down the
root cause. Signs and symptoms of liver cancer often do not show up until the later stages of the
disease. However, sometimes they may show up sooner. Going to the doctor when these
symptoms first appear might allow the cancer to be diagnosed earlier. Hence, treatment is most
likely to be helpful."
1,104,1,104110,10,pTitle0104110,"Doctor could order lab tests for a number of reasons, from diagnosing liver cancer to determining
what might have been the underlying cause. Labs also inform a patient’s general health and how
well other organs are working, which also could influence treatments. All of these labs typically
follow a thorough physical exam and medical history. They help to differentiate various causes
of similar complaints. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein that can be found in high levels in
adults with liver disease, liver cancer, and pregnant women. As a result, high AFP levels aren’t
very specific in determining if a liver mass might be cancer. This test, however, could be useful
in people already diagnosed with liver cancer. The AFP level can help determine treatment
options. The test can also be used after treatment, to look for possible signs that the cancer is
recurring. Since the liver also synthesizes proteins that help blood clot, doctors will also order
clotting tests to measure risk of bleeding. In a similar vein, liver function test (LFT) measures
various enzymes to assess the condition of the liver before starting treatment. The complete
blood count (CBC) measures blood cells and platelets, which help infer how the bone marrows
are functioning. A single lab value is seldom informative in isolation. Accounting for different
lab values can paint a fuller picture of the patient’s sickness."
1,104,1,104111,11,pTitle0104111,"Liver cancer survivors can be affected by a number of health problems. One of the major
concern is facing cancer again. Cancer that comes back after treatment is called a recurrence. But
some cancer survivors develop a new, unrelated cancer later. This is called a second cancer.
Unfortunately, being treated for liver cancer doesn’t mean a patient can’t get another cancer.
People who have had liver cancer can still get the same types of cancers that other people get. In
fact, they might be at higher risk for certain types of cancer. The little information that is known
shows that there is an increased risk to develop cancer in the kidneys, ovaries, oral cavity, and
thyroid. After completing treatment, patients should still check-in with doctor regularly and
report any new problems. New problems could be due to the original cancer spreading or
recurring, or by a new disease or second cancer. Liver cancer survivors should also follow the
American Cancer Society guidelines for the early detection of cancer, such as those for
colorectal, breast, cervical, and prostate cancer. Screening tests can find some cancers early,
when they are likely to be treated more successfully. For people who have had liver cancer, most
experts don’t recommend any additional testing to look for second cancers unless they have
symptoms or if you or your family have an inherited disease."
1,104,2,104201,01,pTitle0104201,"A cancer in the liver can be primary or secondary. A primary liver cancer is a cancer that starts in
the liver, while a secondary cancer is spread to the liver from other sites. Doctors make
the diagnosis with a combination of imaging test and biopsy, where they use a needle to remove
some liver tissues. They may also detect specific markers in the bloodstream. The liver has many
important functions to sustain life, such as breaking down and storing nutrients absorbed from
the intestine. Since tumors can impair normal liver functions, they must be destroyed or removed
before cancerous cells affect nearby lymph nodes and blood vessels. Some liver cancers are
potentially resectable. Usually, resectable cancer is found in early stage and the rest of the liver is
healthy. Liver transplant may also be recommended if the tumor is hard to remove. However,
candidates for liver transplant might have to wait a long time for a liver to become available.
When the cancers are widespread, they cannot be treated with surgery. These more advanced
cases are unresectable and require alternative treatments. Patients may receive drug therapy to
keep the cancer under control, such as immunotherapy and chemotherapy. These therapies may
not cure the patient completely, and they often have significant side effects."
1,104,2,104202,02,pTitle0104202,"Doctors use a practical system to determine treatment options for liver cancers. Some tumors are
categorized as resectable or transplantable. Others are unresectable, inoperable, or advanced. In
resectable cases, the cancer is a local tumor and the rest of the liver is healthy. Factors that may
influence the surgery outcome are the tumor size and if nearby blood vessels are affected. Liver
transplant may also be an option if the tumor is in a part of the liver that makes it hard to remove.
It can be appropriate for patients with cirrhosis and not enough amount of liver function left to
sustain life. Candidates for liver transplant may have a long waitlist for a donor liver to become
available. While they are waiting, they are often given other treatments to keep the cancer under
control. Unresectable cancers include cancers that haven’t yet spread to lymph nodes or distant
sites, but can’t be removed safely. Main treatment options for these can involve drug therapy or
techniques that destroy liver tumors without removing them, such as ablation. Some inoperable
cancers are small enough and in the right place to be removed by surgery, but the patient isn’t
healthy enough for the operation. Advanced liver cancer has spread either to the lymph nodes or
to other organs. Because these cancers are widespread, they require more aggressive treatments."
1,104,2,104203,03,pTitle0104203,"The best option to cure liver cancer is with either surgical resection or a liver transplant. If all
cancer in the liver is completely removed, the patient will have the best outlook. Partial
hepatectomy is surgical method to remove part of the liver. Only people with good liver function
who are healthy enough for surgery and who have a single local tumor can have this operation.
Imaging tests are done first to see if the cancer can be removed completely. Most patients with
liver cancer in the United States also have cirrhosis. People with cirrhosis are typically eligible
for surgery if there is only one tumor that has not grown into blood vessels. They will still need a
reasonable amount of normal liver function left once the tumor is removed. Liver resection is a
major operation that should only be done by skilled surgeons with experienced techniques.
Preoperative planning may be guided with ultrasound or CT scan. Some likely risks are bleeding,
infection, and blood clots. When it is available, liver transplants can be a good option for those
with unresectable tumors. In general, a transplant is used to treat patients with small tumors that
have not grown into nearby blood vessels. With a transplant, not only is the risk of a second new
liver cancer greatly reduced, but the new liver will function normally."
1,104,2,104204,04,pTitle0104204,"Ablation is treatment that destroys liver tumors without removing them. These techniques can be
used in patients with a few small tumors and when surgery is not a good option. They are less
likely to cure the cancer than surgery, but they can still be very helpful for some people, such as
patients waiting for a liver transplant. Ablation is best used for tumors no larger than 3 cm.
Because ablation often destroys some of the normal tissue around the tumor, it might not be a
good choice for treating tumors near major blood vessels or bile ducts. Often, ablation can be
done without surgery by inserting a needle or probe into the tumor through the skin. Patients are
under general anesthesia or sedation to ensure safety and comfort. The needle or probe is guided
into place with ultrasound or CT scan. Radiofrequency ablation is one of the most common
methods for small tumors. It uses high-energy radio waves. The doctor inserts a thin, needle-like
probe into the tumor through the skin. A high-frequency current is then passed through the tip of
the probe, which heats the tumor and destroys the cancer cells. Other techniques involve using
microwave to heat and destroy the tumor, or by freezing it using a thin metal probe. Possible side
effects after ablation therapy include abdominal pain, infection in the liver, fever and abnormal
liver tests."
1,104,2,104205,05,pTitle0104205,"Embolization is a procedure that injects substances directly into an artery in the liver to reduce
the blood flow to a tumor in the liver. The liver is unique in that it has 2 blood supplies. Most
normal liver cells are fed by the portal vein. However, a cancer in the liver is mainly fed by the
hepatic artery. Blocking the part of the hepatic artery that feeds the tumor helps destroy the
cancer cells. It leaves most of the healthy liver cells unharmed because they get their blood
supply from the portal vein. Embolization is an option for some patients with tumors that cannot
be removed by surgery. It can be used for people with tumors that are too large for ablation
(usually larger than 5 cm) but adequate liver function. It can also be used with ablation.
Embolization can reduce blood supply to the normal liver tissue. Therefore, it may not be a good
option for patients with diseases such as hepatitis or cirrhosis. There are several techniques for
embolization, but it isn’t clear which type of has a better long-term outcome. Drug for local
anesthesia will be injected, and the doctor will thread a catheter through the artery that supplies
the blood to the liver. Possible side effects after embolization therapy include abdominal pain,
infection in the liver, fever and blood clots in the main vessels."
1,104,2,104206,06,pTitle0104206,"There are several techniques for embolization, but it isn’t clear which type of has a better long-
term patient outcome for liver cancer. During trans-arterial embolization, a catheter (a thin, long
tube) inserts into an artery in the inner thigh through a small cut. The doctor will then thread the
catheter into the hepatic artery in the liver. A dye is usually injected into the blood vessels to
help the doctor watch the path of the catheter. Once the catheter is in place, small particles are
injected into the artery to plug it up, reducing the blood supply to the cancer. This procedure can
be combined with chemotherapy (chemo). Most often, this is done by giving chemo through the
catheter directly into the artery. Blocking the artery allows the chemo to stay close to the tumor.
This method is used for large liver cancers that cannot be treated with surgery or ablation.
Another treatment option combines embolization with radiation therapy. This is done by
injecting small beads that have radioactive substances into the hepatic artery to destroy tumor
cells. Once infused, the beads spread in the blood vessels near the tumor. They give off small
amounts of radiation to the tumor site for several days. The radiation travels a very short
distance, so its effects are limited only to the tumor.
"
1,104,2,104207,07,pTitle0104207,"Radiation therapy uses high-energy or small particles to destroy cancer cells. It may not be a
good option for some patients whose liver has been damaged by diseases such as cirrhosis.
Radiation can be helpful in treating large liver tumors that cannot be treated with surgery or
ablation. Most often, these patients' cancers have also spread through blood vessels to distant
body sites. There are several techniques, one of which is called external beam radiation therapy.
During the procedure, the doctor focuses radiation from outside the body on the cancer. Most
often, this treatment uses small doses given 5 days a week for several weeks. There are also
newer techniques that help doctors target liver tumors while reducing the damage to nearby
healthy tissues. Another option combines embolization with radiation therapy. This is done by
injecting small beads that have radioactive substances into the hepatic artery to destroy tumor
cells. The radiation travels a very short distance, so its effects are limited only to the tumor. A
common side effect of these therapies may be skin changes in areas getting treated. Others
include diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. These side effects usually don’t
last long and go away after treatment is finished"
1,104,2,104208,08,pTitle0104208,"Chemotherapy (chemo) is treatment with drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemo may be an option
for people with large liver tumors that cannot be treated with surgery or ablation. Unfortunately,
most chemo drugs do not have great effects on liver cancer based on long-term patient outcome.
Recent studies have shown that a combination of drugs may be more helpful than using just a
single chemo drug. But even these combinations of drugs shrink only a small number of tumors,
and the responses often do not last long. Patients can get chemotherapy in different ways, but
they often come with side effects. These side effects usually don’t last long and go away after
treatment is finished. They also depend on the type and dose of drugs, as well as how long they
are given. Common side effects include diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting.
Others may be hair loss, increased chance of infections, and easy bruising or bleeding. Many of
these occur because chemo drugs not only damage abnormal tumor cells, but also normal cell
types that divide quickly, such as those found in bone marrow. There are several techniques to
perform chemotherapy. Systemic therapy can spread through blood vessels to reach distant body
sites. Regional therapy focuses the chemo on liver tumors while reducing the damage to healthy
tissues."
1,104,2,104209,09,pTitle0104209,"When treating liver cancer, doctors may select from different chemotherapy drugs and
techniques based on patient response and side effects. In systemic therapy, drugs are injected
right into a vein (IV) or taken by mouth. These drugs enter the blood vessels and reach almost all
areas of the body. Therefore, this treatment can be helpful for cancers that have spread to distant
organs. For IV chemo, a type of catheter called a central line is required to administer chemo as
well as take blood out for testing. Doctors give chemo in cycles. Each period of treatment is
followed by a rest period to give patients time to recover from the effects of the drugs. Cycles are
most often 2 or 3 weeks long depending on the drugs given. Unlike systemic therapy, regional
therapy focuses the chemo on liver tumors while reducing the damage to healthy tissues. One
method called hepatic artery infusion puts an infusion pump under the skin of the abdomen. The
pump is attached to a catheter that connects to the hepatic artery. It then releases the chemo
slowly to shrink the tumors. It gets a higher dose of chemo to the tumor, providing an option for
people with large liver tumors that cannot be treated with surgery or ablation. However, patients
can still have side effects like diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting."
1,104,2,104210,10,pTitle0104210,"As doctors learn more about the changes in cells that cause cancer, they have developed newer
drugs that specifically target these changes. Targeted drugs have different functions from
chemotherapy drugs and often have different side effects. Like chemotherapy, these drugs enter
the blood vessels and reach almost all areas of the body. This makes them potentially helpful
against cancers that have spread to distant sites of the body. However, chemo has not shown
great outcome in most patients with liver cancer, so doctor focuses more on using targeted
therapies. One type of targeted therapy is called kinase inhibitors. They block several kinase
proteins on or near the cell surface. Kinases can directly help tumor cells grow, or help tumors
form the new blood vessels to get larger. These drugs are often taken by mouth with different
cycles. Common side effects include fatigue, loss of appetite, high blood pressure, weight loss,
diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Another type of drug is man-made antibodies acting like immune
response proteins attached to a select target. They damage a tumor’s ability to form new blood
vessels, which supply it with nutrients. These are given as infusion through catheter into a vein,
usually once every 2 or 3 weeks depending on the drugs. Both can be good options for people
with large liver tumors that cannot be treated with surgery."
1,104,2,104211,11,pTitle0104211,"For some people with liver cancer, treatment can remove or destroy the cancer. Patients may be
relieved after treatment finished, but also worry about cancer coming back. Many may still get
treatments with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other therapies to help keep the cancer under
control for as long as possible. Unfortunately, some treatment side effects might last a long time
or might not even show up for several years. Common side effects include fatigue, loss of
appetite, high blood pressure, weight loss, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Therefore, doctor
follow-up is a good way to talk about any changes or problems. Patients can also learn more
about newer drugs that specifically target liver cancer, such as kinase inhibitors and man-made
antibodies. These drugs can directly block cell growth or damage a tumor’s ability to form new
blood vessels. Follow-up is needed to check for cancer recurrence or spread to distant sites of the
body. If someone has been treated with surgery and shows no signs of recurrence, doctors
recommend follow-up with imaging and blood tests every 3 to 6 months. For people with large
liver tumors that cannot be treated with surgery, they may need more follow-ups. Focusing on
early treatment of potential cancer may come with better long-term patient outcomes. It also
allows patients to learn more about their options.

1,105,1,105101,01,pTitle0105101,"Colorectal cancer starts in the colon or rectum, which make up the large intestine in digestive
system. The wall of colon and rectum is composed of many layers. Colorectal cancer starts in the
innermost layer of large intestine and can grow outward through some or all of the other layers.
It often bleeds into the digestive tract. Over time, blood loss can build up and lead to low red
blood cell counts. Screening allows early detection of polyps, and regular screening may even
prevent cancer. Screening is performed either with a sensitive test that looks for signs of cancer
in a person’s stool, or through a visual exam with colonoscopy. These preventative care
measures are generally covered by private insurance or Medicare. People have different risk
factors and health history that determine their age to begin screening. To diagnose and stage
colorectal cancer, a doctor may order blood test, colonoscopy, and sample biopsy. The stage of a
tumor depends on how deeply it grows into intestinal wall and if it has spread outside the
intestine. Finding cancer early, when it's small and hasn't spread, often allows for more treatment
options. Local therapies target the tumor without affecting other parts, while systemic therapies
reach cancer cells throughout patient’s body. Based on treatment options, people might benefit
from different types of doctors on their care team."
1,105,1,105102,02,pTitle0105102,"Caner entails a wide variety of diseases rather than one single type, and it is a complex group of
diseases with many possible causes. A cancer tumor may start anywhere in the body, such as
lungs, breast, colon, or even blood. Cancers share similar developmental traits, but they also
differ in how they grow and progress. They begin when abnormal cells divide uncontrollably and
crowd out normal cells, making it difficult for the body to function the way it should. Normal
cells divide in an orderly fashion. They die when they are worn out or damaged, followed by
new cells taking their place. On the other hand, cancerous cells often lack the regulatory
mechanisms found in normal cells due to mutations in the DNA. Therefore, they keep on
proliferating and replacing normal cells, a process called dysplasia. Dysplasia causes problems in
affected organs. Cancers can advance at different rates, as well as showing a range of treatment
response. Some are best treated with surgery, while others respond better to drugs called
chemotherapy. Usually, multiple treatments are combined to obtain the best results. In clinical
practice, doctors also need to first find out the extent of cancerous spread, or metastasis.
Knowing the tumor staging allows oncologists, or specialized cancer doctors, to determine the
most favorable treatment approach."
1,105,1,105103,03,pTitle0105103,"Most colorectal cancers start as growth on the large bowel. These tissue protrusions are called
polyps. Biopsied polyp tissue samples are studied under the microscope by specialized doctors
called pathologists. There are 2 main categories of polyps, adenomotous and hyperplastic.
Adenomatous polyp, or adenomas, is a polyp made up of tissue that looks much like normal
lining of the bowels. Adenomas sometimes advance into cancer; therefore, these polyps are
considered a pre-cancerous condition. The alternative variety is called hyperplastic polyp. These
have higher prevalence, but in general they are not pre-cancerous. Several factors might cause a
polyp more likely to contain cancer, such as a polyp larger than 1 cm, multiple polyps, or if
dysplasia is seen. Dysplasia is another pre-cancerous condition. It means that there's an area
within a polyp or along the digestive tract where cells look abnormal are not truly malignant.
Polyps can have either low-grade or high-grade dysplasia depending on how orderly their
structure appears. If any polyp is found during physical exam, the most important thing to
confirm is that the polyp has been completely removed and does not demonstrate cancer. The
growth pattern only matters because it helps physicians to determine when patients will need to
get their next examination going forward."
1,105,1,105104,04,pTitle0105104,"After someone has been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, doctors will try to figure out if it has
spread, and if so, how far. This process is called staging, which describes how much cancer is
present inside one's body. It helps determine how serious the disease is and how best to address
it. Doctors also apply cancer staging when talking about survival statistics. The most established
staging system is the TNM system, which is based on 3 key pieces of information. “T” in TNM
stands for tumor size, indicating how far has the cancer grown into the intestinal wall. The inner-
most surface of the bowel is called mucosa, where nearly all colorectal cancers originate. The
mucosa also contains a thin muscle layer called muscularis mucosa. Outside the mucosa is
fibrous tissue called submucosa, followed by a thick muscle layer called muscularis propria. The
outermost surface is called serosa, a thin connective tissue covering most of the colon. “N” in
TNM stands for lymph nodes, indicating whether cancerous cells have moved to nearby lymph
nodes. Affected lymph nodes usually require surgical resection along with the tumor itself. “M”
in TNM stands for metastasis, indicating whether the malignancy has affected distant organs like
liver or lungs. Metastasis indicates late-stage disease and the worst prognostic outcome."
1,105,1,105105,05,pTitle0105105,"Surgery is often the main treatment for earlier-stage colon cancers, identified prior to metastasis.
Any type of colon surgery needs to be done on a clean and empty colon. Some early colon
cancers and most polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy. This procedure uses a long
flexible tube with a small video camera on the end that's put into the person’s rectum and colon.
For a polyp removal, the cancer is removed as part of the polyp, which is cut at its stalk (the part
that looks like the stem of a mushroom). A local excision is a slightly more involved procedure
that require greater surgical skills. Tools are used through the colonoscope to remove small
cancers on the internal lining of the colon along with some healthy tissue. A colectomy is
surgery to remove all or part of the colon. If only part of the colon is removed, the procedure is
called a partial colectomy or segmental resection. If all of the colon is removed, it's called a total
colectomy. Total colectomy can be done in 2 ways. Open colectomy is achieved through a single
long cut in the abdomen. Laparoscopic colectomy is done through many smaller incisions and
special tools. Because the cuts are smaller in a laparoscopic colectomy, patients often recover
faster and have fewer scars."
1,105,1,105106,06,pTitle0105106,"Chemotherapy is often used to treat colorectal cancer. This approach uses toxic chemical drugs
to kill cancer cells. In systemic chemotherapy, drugs are infused straight into the blood through a
vein or taken by mouth. The drugs enter bloodstream and reach all areas of the body, which can
help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer spreading to other parts of the body. In regional
chemotherapy, drugs are injected right into an artery that leads to the part of the body with the
tumor. This focuses the drug's toxicity on the cancer cells located in that area. It therefore
reduces side effects by limiting the amount of drug reaching the rest of the body. Chemotherapy
may be used at different time points during treatment for colorectal cancer. Adjuvant chemo is
given after surgery to kill cancer cells that might have been left behind from surgery.
Neoadjuvant chemo is given before surgery to shrink the cancer and make the tumor easier to
remove. Chemotherapy drugs attack cells that are dividing quickly, which is why they work
against cancer cells. However, some normal cells in the body are also dividing quickly. These
cells can be affected by chemotherapy too, which can lead to side effects. Side effects may
include hair loss, mouth sores, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting."
1,105,1,105107,07,pTitle0105107,"Lynch syndrome is the most common hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome. It is also known as
hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer. Lynch syndrome accounts for about 2% to 4% of all
colorectal cancers. In most cases, this disorder is caused by an inherited defect in either the
MLH1 or MSH2 gene, but changes in other genes can also cause Lynch syndrome. These genes
normally help repair DNA that has been damaged. When abnormal cancer cells proliferate too
quickly without DNA repair, the disease becomes worse. The cancers associated with this
syndrome tend to develop when people are relatively young. People with Lynch syndrome can
have polyps, but they typically only have a few. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer in people
with this condition may be as high as 80%, but this depends on which gene is affected. Women
with this condition also have a very high risk of developing cancer in the lining of the uterus.
Other cancers linked with Lynch syndrome include cancer of the ovary, stomach, small intestine,
pancreas, kidney, prostate, breast, brain, and so on. People with Lynch syndrome may need to
begin frequent screening at a young age. This will allow doctors to identify the cancer at an early
stage before the cancerous cells have spread to many organs. If found too late, the cancer would
be harder to treat and may require systemic therapy."
1,105,1,105108,08,pTitle0105108,"To understand colorectal cancer, it helps to understand the anatomy of the colon and rectum.
Most of the large intestine consists of the colon, a muscular tube about 5 feet long. In normal
anatomy, each compartment of the colon is named by which direction food travels through them.
The first compartment is the ascending colon, which starts with a pouch called the cecum. The
cecum receives semi-digested food from the small intestine, and it extends upward on the right
side of the belly. The second compartment is aptly called the transverse colon, traversing across
from right to left. The third compartment is the descending colon because it travels downward on
the left side. The fourth compartment is the sigmoid colon because of its “S” shape. The sigmoid
colon is followed by the rectum, which connects to the anus. The ascending and transverse
sections together are called the proximal colon, while the descending and sigmoid colon are
jointly called the distal colon. The colon absorbs excessive water and salt from the partially
processed food matter after it goes through the small intestine. The remaining waste matter
empties into the rectum, the final compartment of the digestive system. Feces are stored there
until excretion through the anus. Ring-shaped sphincter muscles contract around the anus to
retain stool, and they relax during a bowel movement."
1,105,1,105109,09,pTitle0105109,"Rates of colorectal cancer cases and deaths vary among different racial and ethnic groups. Some
of the differences are due to risk factors including smoking and excess body weight as well as
access to health care and colorectal cancer screening. African Americans have the highest
colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates of all racial groups in the US. Jews of Eastern
European descent (Ashkenazi Jews) have one of the highest colorectal cancer risks of any ethnic
group in the world. Incidence rates of colorectal cancer during 2012-2016 were lowest among
Asian/Pacific islanders at 30 per 100,000. Incidence rates for non-Hispanic whites were 39 per
100,000 and for blacks they were 46 per 100,000. The highest rate was among Alaska Natives at
89 per 100,000. Mortality rates followed similar trend, however the difference among groups is
about twice as large. For example, colorectal cancer rates are about 20% higher in blacks than
non-Hispanic whites, but death rates are almost 40% higher in blacks. Among Alaska Natives,
death rates are about double those in blacks. American Indians and Alaska Natives are the only
racial group where colorectal cancer death rates are not declining. Mortality rates for colorectal
cancer also vary by age group. From 2008-2017, death rates declined by 3% per year in people
65 and older, but only went down by 0.6% in people 50 to 64. They increased by 1.3% in those
younger than 50."
1,105,1,105110,10,pTitle0105110,"For women with a certain genetic makeup, being overweight or obese raises the risk for
colorectal cancer, according to a recent study. Researchers know that being overweight or obese
is a risk factor for colorectal cancer. But how body weight affects colorectal cancer risk is
complicated. In this study, researchers looked at whether the risk was affected by the interaction
of body mass index (BMI, a measure of obesity based on height and weight) with variations in a
gene called SMAD7. They found that in women with certain variants in the SMAD7 gene, a
higher BMI was linked with a higher risk of colorectal cancer. However, there weren’t any
significant interactions in men. Previous studies have shown that a high BMI by itself raises the
risk in men more than in women. The research team verified this finding. Studying BMIs of
about 14,000 adults with colorectal cancer and 14,000 adults without it, they found that men had
a 26% increased risk for every 5-point increase in BMI. Women had a 14% increased risk for
each 5-point increase in BMI. Previous research has also found that certain inherited genetic
variants increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Adding obesity on top of a high-risk genetic
makeup is like a second hit in women. These results can serve as a reminder that obesity is
linked with a lot of health problems, including cancer."
1,105,1,105111,11,pTitle0105111,"A study by a group of scientists from organizations including the American Cancer Society finds
that higher levels of vitamin D in the blood is associated with a lower risk for colorectal cancer.
Previous studies have suggested a link but were inconclusive. The scientists combined data from
17 studies that follow people over time to determine why some of them got colorectal cancer.
The analysis is the largest to date, using data from about 12,800 people. All participants were
tested for vitamin D levels in their blood before diagnosis. Often, this measure was taken when
they initially joined the study. They became part of the new analysis because they developed
colorectal cancer. Another group was matched to the study group by age, race and date of blood
draw. These “matched” controls were people who did not have colorectal cancer. All the blood
was tested or re-tested using the same method for consistency. The outcome is that people with
deficient serum vitamin D levels had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during the length of
time they were followed. People can get vitamin D from their diet, from supplements, and from
the sun. However, staying out in the sun without protection exposes people to harmful UV rays.
And getting too much vitamin D from taking high doses of supplements can also be harmful."

1,105,2,105202,02,pTitle0105202,"Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the US. Its death rate has been dropping
steadily because polyps are now more often found by screening and removed before they can
grow into cancers. Screening is the detection process that looks for cancer or pre-cancer in
people who may not manifest symptoms like blood loss. Regular screening is one of the most
powerful weapons against colorectal cancer. This preventive care is especially important for
people with more risk factors and personal history. Screening allows doctors to find colorectal
cancer early, when it's small, hasn't spread throughout the body, and might be easier to treat.
Regular screening is performed through stool testing or colonoscopy. A polyp generally takes as
many as 10 to 15 years to develop into cancer. When colorectal cancer is found at an early stage
before it has metastasized, the 5-year relative survival rate can reach 90%. But only about 4 out
of 10 colorectal cancers are identified at this early stage. When cancer has spread outside the
colon or rectum through the intestinal wall, survival rates are lower. Sadly, about 1 in 3
American who should get tested for colorectal cancer have never been screened. This may be
because they don't know that regular screening could save their lives from the disease. This
could also be due to different things like cost and health insurance coverage issues."
1,105,2,105203,03,pTitle0105203,"The American Cancer Society recommends that people at average risk of colorectal cancer start
regular screening at age 45. This is because colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death,
especially when tumor cells have spread throughout the body at a later stage. Screening can be
done with a sensitive test that detects hidden blood or DNA in a person’s stool, and alternatively
with a colonoscopy visual exam that looks at the colon and rectum. People at increased or high
risk of colorectal cancer might need to start screening before age 45. They might also be
screened more often or get specific tests. Increased risks include a strong family or personal
history of colorectal cancer or certain polyps. They also include people who had radiation to the
belly or pelvic area to treat a prior cancer. High risks include inflammatory bowel disease and
genetic syndromes. These people often need to have colonoscopy performed at an early age.
People who are in good health and with a life expectancy of more than 10 years have lower risk.
They should continue regular cancer screening through the age of 75. For people ages 76 through
85, the decision to be screened should be based on their preferences. It depends on their life
expectancy, overall health, and prior screening history. People over 85 should no longer get
cancer screening."
1,105,2,105204,04,pTitle0105204,"Several different tests can be used to screen for colorectal cancer based on personal preference,
and they can be divided into stool-based tests and visual exams. Stool-based tests check the stool
for early signs of colorectal cancer. These screening tests are generally less invasive and easier,
but people must do them more often. One sensitive approach to test for colorectal cancer is to
look for suspicious hidden blood in stool. The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) looks for hidden
blood by detecting increased hemoglobin protein found in red blood cells. There are no
preparation or dietary restrictions before the test, and collecting the samples might be easier for
people. The guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) is an alternative way to detect hidden
blood in the stool. Some food or drug can also affect the results, such as red meats. Both FIT and
gFOBT screening must be done on a regular basis every year. If hidden blood is detected, a
follow-up through colonoscopy will be needed to investigate potential polyps in these people
further. On the other hand, a stool DNA test looks for abnormal DNA from cancer or polyp cells.
Colorectal cancer or polyp cells often have DNA mutations in certain genes. Intestinal cells from
the rectum or colon wall with these mutations often get into the stool. Stool DNA screening is
performed every 3 years."
1,105,2,105205,05,pTitle0105205,"Besides stool-based tests, visual exams are another option for people to screen for and prevent
colorectal cancer. These screening tests can be performed less often, but they require more
preparation ahead of time, and can have some risks. Visual exams look at the wall structure of
the colon and rectum for any abnormal areas. This can be done with colonoscopy, using a
flexible tube about the width of a finger with a video camera attachment on the end. It is inserted
through the anus and into the rectum and colon. Special instruments can be passed through the
tube to sample or remove any suspicious areas such as polyps. The colon and rectum must be
empty and clean before the test. This can be achieved through a combination of drugs and fluids.
Colonoscopy is generally a safe cancer screening procedure performed by skilled doctors.
However, the procedure can rarely puncture the wall of the colon or rectum, causing blood loss.
Most insurance plans cover preventative care with colonoscopy screening every 10 years. Some
people cannot tolerate the dietary restrictions and bowel preparation required before
colonoscopy. They might choose stool-based tests to detect cancer signs, such as hidden blood in
stool or DNA mutation in cells. While more regularly done, these tests are safer and easier to
them in comparison."
1,105,2,105206,06,pTitle0105206,"If colonoscopy is too invasive for some people, an alternative visual exam to screen for
colorectal cancer is a computed tomography (CT) scan of the colon and rectum. A CT scan uses
x-rays, but unlike a regular x-ray, it takes many pictures. The instrument rotates around the
patient on a table. A computer then combines these pictures into images of the abdomen. The
inner view of the colon and rectum allows the doctor to look for polyps or cancer. This cancer
screening test is not invasive like a colonoscopy. However, the same type of bowel preparation is
required. The colon and rectum must be empty and clean before the test. This can be achieved
through a combination of drugs and fluids. A small, flexible tube is also put in the anus to fill the
colon and rectum with air. Rarely, this procedure could puncture the intestinal wall causing
blood loss, but this risk is much lower than with colonoscopy. If polyps or other suspicious areas
are detected, a colonoscopy follow-up will be needed to remove them or to investigate further for
potential cancer. Insurance coverage could be another factor, and patients should decide based on
personal preferences. Medicare generally covers both stool-based tests and colonoscopy for
preventative cancer screening, but not the cost of CT scan."
1,105,2,105207,07,pTitle0105207,"For both colonoscopy and CT visual exam, the colon and rectum must be empty and clean so the
doctor can see the inner lining during the test. There are different ways to achieve this, including
pills, fluids, or combinations of these. For example, patients might need to drink large amounts
of liquid laxatives before the procedure. The process of cleaning out the colon and rectum is
sometimes unpleasant. Therefore, it can make some people choose stool-based screening for
hidden blood, which is performed more regularly but less invasive. Newer kits are available to
clean out the bowel and may be better tolerated, but they may cost more based on insurance
coverage. The doctor can discuss the options with patients prior to preventative screening. This
will address different personal preferences. They will also provide specific instructions. It’s
important to read them a few days ahead of time. Dietary restriction is generally needed for
bowel preparation. Some people may need to follow a special diet for at least a day before the
test and to shop for laxatives. People who normally takes prescription medicines should also talk
with their doctor about how to manage them for that day. Bowel preparation allows polyps or
other suspicious areas to be better detected for potential colorectal cancer."
1,105,2,105208,08,pTitle0105208,"Patients can choose between to screen for colorectal cancer. However, there are several things to
consider before they make that decision. Stool-based tests are not the best option for everyone.
They are recommended for people who have an average risk for colorectal cancer, including
those with no personal or family history. However, stool-based tests are much easier and do not
require bowel preparation. Visual or structural tests are invasive tests that look inside the colon
and rectum for abnormal areas that might be cancer or polyps. Dietary restriction is generally
needed, and patients might need to drink large amounts of a liquid laxative solution the evening
before the procedure. Therefore, it can make some people choose stool-based cancer screening.
Besides these differences, the cost of cancer screening may be another concern. For example,
Medicare covers both stool-based tests and colonoscopy for screening, but not the cost of CT
scan. In addition, not all state Medicaid programs cover cancer screening. Some people might
also pay more if the doctor is not in their plan’s network. Just like prescription medicines,
insurance often decides what preventative care is available. People who has questions can
discuss the options with the health care provider prior to cancer screening."
1,105,2,105209,09,pTitle0105209,"The Affordable Care Act requires private insurers and Medicare to cover colorectal screening
tests, which detect cancer at an early stage. It states that there should be no out-of-pocket costs
for these preventative screening tests, such as co-pays or deductibles. Screening can be done with
a sensitive test that looks for signs of cancer in a person’s stool, including hidden blood and
DNA. Another option is a visual exam with colonoscopy. Many people choose the colonoscopy
screening test, which only needs to be performed once every 10 years. Although many private
insurance plans cover its costs as a screening test, patients still might be required to pay for
certain things. For example, if the doctor is not in the plan’s network, patients may have to pay
more out-of-pocket. Medicare covers an initial preventive physical exam that is available for all
new Medicare patients. However, it must be done within one year of enrolling. Medicare covers
both stool-based tests and colonoscopy for screening, but not the cost of CT scan. If a stool-
based screening test is positive, the follow-up can be considered diagnostic. The doctor will need
to investigate any suspicious areas and potential polyps further. Therefore, patients may have to
pay the usual deductible and co-pay. Unlike Medicare, not all state Medicaid programs cover
cancer screening in people without symptoms."
1,105,2,105210,10,pTitle0105210,"According to a study from the American Cancer Society, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has led
to better treatment for young adults diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The ACA allows young
adults up to age 26 to be covered under their parents’ private health care insurance. However,
Medicare and Medicaid programs are not included. The study states that the provision has helped
these young adults get diagnosed earlier and start some treatments sooner. It reduces their out-of-
pocket costs, such as co-pays or deductibles. When suspicious areas and potential polyps are
detected, these patients can get better access to health care. The researchers used data from more
than 10,000 young adults diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2007 and 2013. They found
patients eligible for their parents’ insurance got better care after the ACA. The people in the
study were too young for regular colorectal cancer screening. Preventative screening, such as
stool-based tests and colonoscopy visual exams, generally began at the age of 45. People at high
risk of colorectal cancer might start screening earlier. Many people choose the colonoscopy
screening test, which only needs to be performed once every 10 years. On the other hand, stool-
based test looks for signs of cancer in a person’s stool. If hidden blood or DNA mutation is
found, the follow-up can be considered diagnostic."
1,105,2,105211,11,pTitle0105211,"Researchers from the American Cancer Society (ACS) found that colorectal cancer screening
rates more than doubled among people ages 45 to 49. This is after the Affordable Care Act
changed its guideline to recommend screening for that age group. The prior guideline
recommended screening to start at age 50 for people at average risk. The ACS updated its
guideline in May 2018, partly because of rising rates of colorectal cancer cases among young
people. This new guideline decreases the age that it recommends people to start screening, from
50 to 45. People at high risk of colorectal cancer might start screening even earlier. Preventative
screening is covered by private health insurance and Medicare. To find out whether the update
made a difference, the researchers looked at responses from 5,800 people ages 45 to 49. These
people reported whether they had any colorectal screening tests during the past year. Their
options included colonoscopy, CT scan, or stool-based testing. Colonoscopy and CT scan are
more invasive exams that look inside the colon for abnormal polyps. Stool-based test detects
signs of cancer in a person’s stool, such as hidden blood and DNA. The researchers believe that
the update made doctors and patients more aware of how important colorectal cancer screening
is. When patients get diagnosed earlier and start treatments sooner, it increases their survival
rate."
