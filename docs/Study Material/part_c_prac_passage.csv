2,201,1,201101,01,pTitle010111,"Cats are native to every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Cats are very specialized meat-eaters. These awesome hunters have fine fur, sharp claws, lethal teeth, acute senses and powerful agile bodies which make them experts at running, climbing, swimming and jumping. Although cats vary in size from the domestic cat to the huge Siberian tiger, they all belong to the same family, the Felidae. There are 38 different species of cat including the tiger, lion, leopard, snow leopard and jaguar."
2,201,1,201102,02,pTitle010112,"Cats have long tails, large ears and sharp claws. A cat’s tail helps it balance as it runs. Cats also use their tails to signal their feelings to other cats.  All cats have rounded ears, which gives them the best possible chance of picking up sounds. The ears can rotate to pick up sounds from many directions. Cats’ claws are retractable. This means they can be pulled into the paws to protect them when running. The hair covering a cat’s paws and pads helps it move silently."
2,201,1,201103,03,pTitle010113,"A cat’s fur coat protects its skin and keeps it warm. The coat’s colors and patterns help to camouflage the cat as it hunts prey. Cats’ coats have two layers – an undercoat of short soft fur and an outercoat of tougher longer hairs, called guard hairs. Together these two layers insulate the cat from extreme cold or heat. Some guard hairs are sensitive and help a cat to feel its way. Cats have loose skin, which can make it difficult for an attacker to get a strong grip. "
2,201,1,201104,04,pTitle010114,"All big cats communicate with one another by signals such as smells, scratches and sounds. The smells come from urine and from scent glands. Every time they rub against something, they transfer their special smell. Cats make many different sounds. For example, lions often roar after sunset following a kill and when they finished eating.  Cats also communicate using body language. They use their ears to signal their mood and twitch their tails to show that they are excited or agitated. "
2,201,1,201105,05,pTitle010115,"Most big cats live alone. They hunt alone and the females bring up their cubs alone. Big cats come together only when they want to mate. They are solitary because there is usually not enough prey in one area for a large group of big cats to live on. Lions are the exception. They live in family groups. All wild cats have territories. These territories are a series of trials that link together a cat’s hunting, drinking and its lookout areas. Females have smaller home range than males. "
2,202,1,202101,01,pTitle010211,"Wild horses once ranged throughout the world. Climate change reduced their numbers until they almost became extinct. However, about 6000 years ago, horses were tamed by people. Thus, many shapes and sizes of horses developed through breeding. Domestic, wild horses, asses and zebras all belong to the same family, called equids. The three groups evolved different characteristics that enabled them to survive in particular habitats. Wild horses lived on the open steppes of Central Asia; zebras, on the grasslands of Southern Africa; and asses, in hot desert lands. "
2,202,1,202103,03,pTitle010213,"Although the horses we know today are different in shapes and sizes due to breeding, these are domestic horses that are tamed by human. Wild horses once ranged all over the world before they become almost extinct due to climate change. Wild horses, asses and zebras all belong to the same family, equids, however, they live in different habitats. The three groups evolved with different characteristics for them to adapt to different habitats, such as the open steppes of Central Asia, the grasslands of Southern Africa, and the hot deserts. "
2,202,1,202104,04,pTitle010214,"Wild horses, asses, zebras and even domestic horses all belong to the same family, equids. They evolved to live in different habitats ranging from the open steppes of Central Asia, grasslands in Southern Africa and the hot deserts. Horses also have different shapes and sizes though breeding given the long history of being tamed by human. Because of climate change, the number of wild horses is largely reduced. Before they became extinct, wild horses once lived all over the world."
2,202,1,202105,05,pTitle010215,"Six thousand years ago, horses were tamed by people and developed into different shapes and sizes through breeding. On the contrary, wild horses become extinct due to climate change. Wild horses, including zebras and asses, all live in different habitats, such as the open steppes, grasslands or hot deserts. The three groups all belong to the same family, equids. Wild horses evolved with different characteristics for surviving in different environments all over the world ranging from Central Asia to Southern Africa. "
2,202,1,202202,02,pTitle010212,"Wild horses are almost extinct due to climate change.  Before the number of wild horses was reduced, they ranged all over the world. In particular, wild horses lived on the open steppes of Central Asia. Their relatives, the zebras, live on the grasslands of Southern Africa, and asses live in hot deserts. The three groups all belong to the same family, equids, and evolved with different characteristics for them to survive in these different habitats.  Because horses have been tamed by people for 6000 years, there are many shapes and sizes of horses through breeding."
2,203,1,203101,01,pTitle010311,"The first apes lived on Earth about 20 million years ago, and they are our closest living relatives. There are four main groups, chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos and orangutans. Nearly 99 percent of our genes are the same as those of a chimpanzee. In fact, chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than they are to gorillas. They are extremely intelligent and are able to solve problems, use tools and communicate.  They can also learn a language, although their vocal cords cannot produce the right range of sounds to speak. 
"
2,203,1,203102,02,pTitle010312,"The newborn gorilla is half the weight of most human babies, but it can grow up to be a heavyweight male that weigh about 440lb. Gorillas are the largest of the four great apes, while chimpanzees and bonobos are the smallest, and are similar in size to a 12-year-old human child. Male apes are up to twice the size and weight of females. This helps them to frighten predators and rivals. Large male gorillas are too heavy for a permanent treetop lifestyle, although they do climb trees for fruit."
2,203,1,203104,04,pTitle010314,"Apes appear to be the brightest of all the nonhuman animals, but it is difficult to measure intelligence. They have larger brains than other species. Scientists think an intelligent animal is one that can solve problems, investigate and adapt to new conditions, behave in a flexible way, remember things, use tools, pass on information from one generation to the next, and even use language. Apes can do all these things, but their throats cannot makes sounds used by humans to produce spoken language. "
2,203,1,203105,05,pTitle010315,"Of all the apes, chimpanzees live in the largest groups, up to 100 individuals. A chimpanzee group is based around the most important male chimpanzee, like gorilla groups, in which one of the male silverbacks leads his group. Bonobos’ society is led by females instead of males. They are very sociable. Most of the time they live in large groups, which are split up into smaller groups when they forage for food. Orangutans usually live on their own, although females often live with their children when they grow up.  "
2,203,1,203203,03,pTitle010313,"An ape’s hands and feet are remarkable. They are very adaptable, and the opposing thumb or big toe enables them to grasp firmly or hold delicately. Ape hands and feet are strong and flexible, allowing apes to climb, swing and jump through the treetops. They also allow apes to reach food, build nests, investigate their surroundings and groom their family and friends. With most apes, the feet looks a lot like hands, but in humans, the feet look different, because human feet are adapted for walking rather than climbing. "
