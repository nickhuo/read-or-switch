              You are being asked to participate in a voluntary research study. The purpose of this study is to understand how people learn information through reading and searching from multiple texts. In this study, you will fill out surveys, learn different topics, answer what you have learned, and complete cognitive ability measures. During the study, you will need to learn several topics under a limit of time. Some topics are more difficult than others. You can decide how you want to allocate your time. The goal is to learn as much as you can. After learning, you will need to report what you have learned and answer comprehension questions. You will receive additional bonus money if the accuracy of your comprehension questions is higher than 90%. Your participation will last about 60 minutes.

              <li>Completing a survey about your demographic information</li>

              During the online information learning task, you will do screen sharing with the researchers, so that the researchers will be able to monitor your progress. At the end of the learning task, you will be asked to recall what you have learned today as much as you can. When you start the recall, the Zoom meeting will be recorded (including the screen capture, your verbal response of free recall). The recall usually takes no more than 5 minutes. The recording will be turned off upon the completion of the recall. We will delete the video recording file (screen capture) right after the end of the study, and delete the audio recording files as soon as we complete the transcription of your recall response. No recording files will be stored for other uses.

              The study will pose no more than minimal risk to you. There is a risk of loss of confidentiality, given that a portion of the Zoom meeting will be recorded. The study is self-paced, with no potential risk of fatigue more than the everyday activities. There is no potential direct benefit to you. However, for our society, the study will advance understandings in learning sciences and have implications for designing technologies to support learning on your own.
